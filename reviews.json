He was as professional as they come and explained everything to me in such a way that I got what it all means in 1 conversation...1 and done as they say. Couldn't be happier and hope you all get as lucky as I was to get a good customer service Rep that actually cares and wants you to have the best introduction possible into any new plans available in your area. Thanks again David...I will definitely reach out if I have any questions.😉💐"

      'text': 'Suzanne was very knowledgeable and helpful in assisting me with the plan that’s made for me. I am a recent liver transplant recipient. And I see specialist and have special managed medicine’s I have to take for the rest of my life. I am very pleased with what I chose this time. I felt that Suzanne, with her warm and caring demeanor took her time to explain everything from her role in assisting me. To the laws, the difference’s in the plans, the medication levels. All that which made me more comfortable about the plan I chose. I mean Suzanne has exceptional people and customer service skills!!👏🏾👏🏾 I’m going to recommend this service to my friends and family because the entire Medicare program is confusing and this process makes it a lot easier to choose when you don’t even know how Medicare managed plans work. Like me. 😊 Thank you so much again. Theressa'

My financial situation was about to change and I could no longer afford to pay $300 per month.  Marleah worked effortlessly in helping me choose the insurance company that was right for me; she did all the work required to obtain that company before the deadline date of Dec. 7th.I think she deserves a medal after having dealt with the likes of me and my partner, Pat.  We were not the easiest people to deal with.

Her attitude and customer relation skills were excellent. The process did take time, but Sabrina was always patient and courteous. She answered all my questions thoughtfully and respectfully. I have gone through this yearly experience of securing an Advantage Plan many times over the years. I can say without a doubt this was by far the best experience I've had in securing my Medicare plan needs. I highly recommend Sabrina to walk you through the process and set you up with the perfect Advantage Plan. She is EXCELLENT!"

He reviewed her current plan and told her that she had an excellent plan and that he could go over other options and compare options if she really wanted to change (she really didn’t)  but that he didn't recommend changes. Not only that he also went above and beyond by walking her through her current benefits showed her how to get the most from them. My mom was so happy and relieved after the call. She said there was no pressure at all and now has peace of mind knowing she has the best plan for her. I will never hesitate to recommend Ensurem!"

Yes the representative had offered such a well informed presentation of the plan and set her goals on ensuring that I would have the opportunity to sign up for coverage that was beneficial to me. She accomplished the goal with First Class Service. Thanks to this representative I  can honestly say I  feel that I  have the best plan. It is such a relief to know that there are people who really care about the impact they have on others.  This was a positive experience for me.

I called today, she seemed quite agitated or irritated, saying that we spent over an hour on the phone going over everything approximately a week or so ago. She assumed I had picked United healthcare in fact I told her I did not make a decision and that is why I was calling back today. I needed more information about several other plans to get all of my doctors under the same Medicare advantage plan. She seemed in a hurry and told me she would call me back. I told her okay it can wait until Monday. Then I realized she did not understand at all what I was trying to do because she several times reminded me that we went over this in our first call. I specifically told her I did not make a decision that day. And I was calling today hoping to make a decision on which plan I wanted to take depending on whether my doctors were in those plans Network. She seemed in a hurry to get off the phone and so we hung up. I decided to go with a different insurance company because I felt she misunderstood our first conversation and I really didn't want to go over everything, I just wanted to find out about two other possibilities. Then I would make a decision. So I did not get a permanent answer and not satisfied. I called back and a different person answered started to explain to her why I am choosing another company. And to let the previous agent know not to call me back. Then all of a sudden I was hung up on. I thought maybe it was a mistake and she would call me back but did not. I tried again and called this time the agent that I was working with answered the phone. Apparently she was not too busy after all. I am very disappointed in feeling rushed and that they expected me to make an a decision without going through my questions. She did not remember our conversation prior to today's correctly. Very disappointed and cannot believe I was hung up on without trying to make the situation better it was made worse by being disrespectful. Letty you had time to answer the phone but you had no time to work with me. Try putting yourself in my situation and others maybe you will have patience for the elderly or disabled. I cannot recommend this insurance company. Not willing to give the required time that it takes to reassure a customer."

Upon talking to the agent Brian Gnivec and researching the Ensurem and Ameritas as I was talking to him, I felt reassured. I was impressed with his good manners, and the amount of time and effort he gave to me as he explored what benefits plan would be best. It was decided my dental plan I have already is best for me and to only add a vision plan. I appreciated his guidance. Once I received my two vision plan ID cards, I noticed only my name was on both. I called Brian to see if my husband was to have a card in his name. He told me my husband would use the extra card with my name. I am grateful for all his help and respectful demeanor.'

I also told him he should become a manager he was so knowledgeable and so patient with me that I signed back up with Aetna to give it another try. I also spoke to his manager and explain to her how wonderful he was and how he took so much time and went over everything with me and he should definitely get a raise and be acknowledged."

So I spoke to one of the people about changing my coverage to a Medicare Advantage Plan too, After finding out about my options, I was signed up for a plan that also came with vision and dental coverage. That was one of the things that won me over because now that I’m retired and on a fixed income, I have to be careful with the money I spend every month. I’m looking forward to receiving the plan’s information book and comparing my monthly spending on medical expenses to what I was previously spending.'

I highly recommend Ensurem has quality representatives who truly care and I even received a follow up call a few days after my enrollment process to rate the representative I had spoken with.

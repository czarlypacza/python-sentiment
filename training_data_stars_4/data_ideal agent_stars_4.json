In hindsight, if I had waited for all offers to come in, I would have likely received an offer from my same agent, KW-- it could have been 2.5% less: $14,250 less fee.I think IA could have advised or suggested to wait for all offers; taking the hot market in consideration and to reiterate the potential savings of having an offer from buyer with my same agent.

She was responsive and quick to reach out to Andrea, which in turn responded to me within 36 hour timeframe (it was the weekend). Andrea met with me on Monday and set up a showing for the Thursday of that week. She was professional, understanding and confidant that she could sell my house within 3 weeks. We got an offer shortly within that time frame and the new buyers were in by December (prepossession) - closing in January of this year.Andrea was very \"on point\" with her promises and follow through. Although we had settled for less than what we wanted, given the \"market\" in our area and its uncertainty, she had kept her promise in transaction and marketing of our house.

It has been a long time since my wife and I have bought or sold property, so the change in the industry and document signage was foreign but easily learned.

On the day of the originally scheduled open house, a younger associate of our senior agent was to show the property, but had difficulty opening the lock box to access the key to the unit. Unable to do so, instead of getting help to solve the problem or at least staying there to make a list of those we had hoped to view the condo, he left. We were very disappointed, especially because our broker thought it very likely that a \"bidding war\" could initiate at that point. The senior agent called and was appropriately apologetic and contacted one of the visitors who missed seeing the property but left his contact information with the neighbor.

As such I rarely buy vintage or antique items off these websites. However, the 2 step purchasing process on Ruby Lane of having to put in an order and then waiting for an invoice is cumbersome. I have also had a few sellers drastically bump up postage costs from what was noted in the listing. The 2 step purchase process gives them the opportunity to do this and as a buyer, there\u2019s not a lot you can do other than cough up the extra postage. This experience is rare however as the vast majority of sellers I\u2019ve dealt with are honest and professional to deal with.It is also sometimes difficult to find the invoice in your purchase history - instead you have to go back to the original email sent by sellers. Seller feedback is also difficult to access. I\u2019m not talking about the number of stars, I\u2019m talking about actual written feedback of a purchaser\u2019s buying experience with a seller.

I would like it if Customer Feedback and Feedback ratings existed on Ruby Lane similarly to how they do on eBay. If they do, I didn't see any sign of it. I feel the possibility of positive or negative feedback is a good incentive for a seller to pack things well, provide tracking and ship in a timely manner after purchase as well as feedback about buyers, as incentive for buyers to be easy to work with and pleasant. 2.) I would have felt more comfortable if the page that had me select payment method had said \"Payment will be completed on next page\". I was nervous that by selecting PayPal, it would automatically charge my default PayPal payment method, which was not the card on PayPal that I wanted to use. Thankfully it did not do that and worked fine, but adding that line would be good.3.) I would like it if Ruby Lane had \"Wish Lists\" that would send buyers notifications if new listings matching Wish-list item keywords were posted.Still, I enjoy the site layout, ease of use, wide variety of payment options and am happy to be a new member.

After contacting customer service, we were informed that because we did not purchase the warranty for the couch, we would be responsible to pay fo $109 for the exchange to receive a new one, we were out raged that when purchasing what should've been a functional item to find that it wasn't functional... only to be told that even though we opted to save money and pick it up ourselves, we were gonna have to pay the same price to have had it delivered to our house anyway??? That was absolutely ridiculous. If any customer ever buys a product and that product was non-functional from the very start, I'm sorry but NO CUSTOMER should EVER have to pay extra to get what they should've received the first time. All this to say, after we expressed our displeasure with this option, Lisa Williams took it on herself to reach out to the store manager and attempt to get approval to waive the $109 this single instance for the replacement delivery, which was approved. We are thankful to her for going out of her way to help us get what we paid for to start with.The only thing I would say is when presenting the options, at least include reaching out the the store manager for this as an option or make some sort of policy to ensure people who buy your products actually get what they paid for in the initial purchase, without an additional charge just to get it fixed. After the purchase sure, customer is responsible without a warranty... but at least give the customer the opportunity to enjoy your products the way they paid for them to be right out of the box. We love the couch, and Lisa was excellent. We are just upset that the couch arrived not functioning the way correctly, and that we were prompted to pay for an additional discounted delivery fee of $69 to get a replacement for what arrived already non-functioning BEFORE we were informed of the potential one-time waived fee from the store managerI am writing this review before the replacement has arrived, so the quality of the replacement is yet to be determined.", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Great Experience", "text": "Shay was professional, knowledgeable and helpful.

To make it right he offered to us a choice of any mattress in the store in exchange. I told him all we wanted was the mattress he sold us. He said he had to bring in two mattresses of our choice and when they come in for us to come down and try them. We got a call they were in and went there and laid on it and it was what we first experienced. Also too Jason offered to deliver them and take the current mattress out of there for free. Tomorrow we are getting the mattress we wanted. Kudos to Jason for listening to us and making it right! He is a man of his word and wants the customer to be happy.

The glue couldn't take the weight and broke apart with me on the bed.

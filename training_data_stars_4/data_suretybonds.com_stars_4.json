I would rate the person who helped me at five stars and the whole experience at 4. I would choose to use them again hands down. It was a solidly good experience. Suggestions for an even better one follow:1. More information up front about what you are filling out online-- why, how, and what to expect when applying for a surety bond for a bonded car title online.2. Connect your automated email system with your recent purchases, as I got a marketing email from you to finish my online application after I'd already completed everything with the gentleman on the phone.3. Ask if you can send marketing emails. Have a check box I can choose no. Unrequested marketing emails are a huge turn off.4. Have employees be more conservative on the turn around time of applications. It was super fast, which I was super happy about, but the customer service rep (who was overall fabulous) said it would be done faster than it actually was done, and I was in a time crunch that particular day. It was still super fast, and I would have been totally impressed even if he'd said longer than he did.Overall great experience. I will use you again, and I hope you take my suggestions into account, so I can feel like I can recommend you to others without, \"but be aware of this and this and this\" caveats.

My original review says it was posted three days ago, which would mean on 20July18, under the name 'BRAD.'  Today, 23July18, I received a call from Suretybonds.  They wanted to discuss my review of their service.  No other company has ever called me to discuss my posted review, good or bad.  The caller (also named Brad by coincidence) informed that SuretyBonds adds no fees to the bonds, or at least, not to the type of bond I was ordered to acquire. If this is true, then it was wrong of me to make a statement to the contrary (I have only their word for this).Brad also informed me that I had been charged only .5% of the amount being bonded.  To that I say, charging m anything for a bond I neither want nor need is going to leave a bad taste in my mouth, regardless of the cost because it still represents an unnecessary expenditure of money out of my pocket.Brad also stated that I could not get the bond form the insurance companies except through a broker (or at least he gave me the impression that I could not if I used any company they represent), which was not completely true based on my understanding of his statement.  I called two other companies, but they took too many days to get back to me. One wanted more than SuretyBonds.  The other finally told me I had to use one of their agents who was in the same state in which I needed the bond, meaning I had to start over and wait again to receive a quote.  This was the same issue I had with the company that gave me the higher price; it took two days to receive a quote, so I was in a bind.  I will give credit to SuretyBonds for being able to issue the bond the same day and on the first phone call.Brad asked me to call if SuretyBonds could do anything for me.  The only thing they could do is issue a refund.  However, if they made no money from charging me fees, there would be nothing to refund as I doubt the insurance company is going to refund my money without cancelling the unnecessary bond I was court-ordered to acquire.Based on their concern about their company's reputation and the fact that they took the time to call me about my review, I felt it only fair to raise their rating and let others know that they do actually pay attention to their customer reviews.", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Quick and easy.", "text": "Date of experience: July 05, 2018", "rating": 4}, {"title": "just went on line to obtain the bond", "text": "when will I receive confirmation on my bond", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Rather painless but affordable", "text": "Rather painless.

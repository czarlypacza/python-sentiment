Definitely agree with the sentiment of most people here that communication between departments is lacking. MASSIVE shout out to Cheyenne, my delivery coordinator, for being the only person assigned to me that I could get a reply from. She was extremely helpful, prompt to reply, let me know when she was going to be out of office\u2026 10/10 there. The other departments, especially contracting, could use some improvement in their communication. I reached out to my contracting agent several times for questions and never heard back. My car was delivered 4 days ago and I still haven\u2019t received my retail contract. Online chat support was helpful in giving me updates and adding notes to my account, but couldn\u2019t do more than ensure someone would follow up (and most of the time, they didn\u2019t).The process was straightforward. Put in request for car, got approved, sent $500 deposit. Uploaded all of my documents (insurance, ID, etc.). Waited for overnighted paperwork that took 3 days to deliver. Got that notarized at UPS and sent it back. Wired the rest of the down payment, and then waited to hear back. Stay communicative to keep the ball rolling. You might not hear back, but patience is definitely key here. You wouldn\u2019t buy a car online if you wanted it instantly. After a few days my contract was approved and delivery was scheduled. The car/delivery itself is also just OK. I didn\u2019t live near any Lithia dealers, so a 3rd party delivery service brought it to me. They gave me a 10 minute heads up that they were about to be at my address, which is a little short notice but thankfully I was already home. About 10 minutes for them to take their pictures and inspect, sign the delivery confirmation on their phone, and done. Car had a few problems I\u2019ve noticed so far. For reference, it\u2019s a 2021 Civic with 39k miles. I\u2019ll be taking it to get a PPI today and will update my review depending on that. No issues/accidents were listed on the listing/CARFAX. However, both key fobs were completely dead, and one of the physical keys won\u2019t fit in the door. The skid plate under the car is partially hanging. It seems to pull left and has something rattling in the back. Additionally, one of the tires was significantly under-inflated, so I\u2019m assuming a leak, and all but one of the valve stem caps on the tires were missing. Needs new wipers and it was pretty dirty too, but that\u2019s an easy fix. Overall, an OK experience so far, and we\u2019ll see how long it takes to get my plates/registration as I know that\u2019s a later roadblock for lots of folks. Just try to stay in contact the best that you can, but expect some delays and have some patience. The agents have 2 days off a week that you might hear nothing, that\u2019s normal.

Problem was while the paper they gave you while waiting for plates was good in Nevada, it isn't in New York. Our 7 day window is far far over and we still don't have plates. We can't drive the car legally weeks after delivery. ADDED: We purchased a car financed on May 24, 2024. Not only have we made the initial insurance payments, but we are due to make the first loan payment on July 7 - and we HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE to drive this car. The tags are stuck in a holding pattern and since the requirements to drive a car in Nevada without tags are not the same as New York, it is literally illegal for us to have this car on the road.

There were definitely moments where I felt hesitant about how exactly the process would work but my team of Driveway reps were very communicative. (Kasandra-Post Delivery, Corey-Delivery Coordinator, Marco-Shop, and Tijerra-Vehicle Registration/DMV)The reason I give this a 4/5 instead of a 5 is due to issues with shipping and a bit of undisclosed damage on my vehicle. At the time of writing this review they are investigating the damage and seeing if it was in the original vehicle photos or not. It\u2019s very minor but from everywhere I searched it was undisclosed in both the CarFax and the contract. However they seem to be very good about getting it fixed if it actually wasn\u2019t disclosed. Now when it comes to the shipping I can\u2019t really blame Driveway as they do use a 3rd party delivery system. However my driver went to initially drop off my vehicle when the location was closed. This caused a delay and confusion about here my vehicle actually was.Thankfully the team and the dealership manager communicated to me the second it hit the lot.With this in mind maybe as DriveWay grows it would be beneficial to have some type of vehicle tracking portal.

Sarah stayed in contact with me throughout the remainder of my transaction. We were on our way to pick up the car within a matter of days. Sarah has been right there everytime I reached out to her and she has made sure to delay my first payment, to reimburse me for insurance while I didn't have the car, even to arrange for us to be picked up from our AirBNB. Driveway, and in particularly Sarah, turned this entire negative experience around and into a more positive one. And my new car is perfect for me. If I could give one piece of advice to Driveway it would be to get a Sarah on every transaction before they go so deeply in the wrong direction. Or train everyone that works there to do the things that Sarah did. A huge thank you to Sarah & the rest of the people at Driveway for taking the time to make things right. It means alot to me. \u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606updated on 5/15/2024 from \u2606 to \u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606.This process has been a nightmare. I am posting this review with the hopes that someone from Driveway will see it & take action. So I started the car buying process with Driveway over 30 days ago. The original vehicle I had picked out & placed a $500 deposit on was sold to someone else. I thought that's why I paid a deposit in the 1st place, but no big deal. However, the person who called to tell me was not the person I had been working with for a week on this. I picked out another vehicle, mainly because they already had my $500. We began the paperwork process on the new vehicle and I waited & waited. After the 2nd week, I was told to get insurance and pay an additional $700 down, so that was done. And then they finally said I could go get the vehicle, only to immediately send me a text to hold off. (I was flying out to get the car to save the 1800 delivery fee because the 1st car had a 600 delivery fee but driveway would do nothing about the 1200 difference even though they sold the 1st car after I paid a deposit to hold it). I was in the process of buying a plane ticket & had I, I would have been out that money too. I had to speak with someone from the finance company who assured me they had everything they needed from me. Then another week went by. I have rarely been called & informed of what's happening during this time. But on this occasion I was called & told that the sales manager wanted to hold the vehicle until they had been paid. I guess my 1200 is just chump change to them. So finally they released the vehicle again, & I begin searching for a plane ticket for the 2nd time. Then believe it or not I get a text to hold off once again. Driveway has made errors on the GAP portion of the contract & the whole deal has to be re-contracted. I only know this because I called the finance company to find out. The finance company has again assured me that they have all they need from me. They were actually under the impression that I had possession of the vehicle. At this point I'm just in shock. I've been told one thing then another throughout this entire deal. I have not had the same person call or text me since that 1st week so who knows who I'm sulposed to call & ask for. It is now over 30 days since I started this. My insurance is due tomorrow for a car I can't drive and I have a payment due on the 26th that I will have to pay. And Driveway thinks they need to hold on to the car until they get their money, yet they can't do their jobs to make sure they do. Meanwhile I'm out over $2000 at this point, still don't have a car to drive, and nobody over there gives a s@it or will do a damn thing about it. People these days just think it's OK to take other people's money and hold it as long as they want while they all sit around not doing their jobs. I wish I had never started this process with them because we're still driving a borrowed car & no money to pay down somewhere else.

Driveway will assign specific people to work with you at specific stages of your transaction. So the first person you work with is the initiation. They get your information, your down payment, and tell you that you must now wait for the next stage which is contracting and someone will get in touch with you. The specific person who initiated the transaction was off for a few days and whenever I tried to get a hold of someone about my transaction they told me that I needed to wait for him to come back. The customer service rep told me that he could check my transaction and said he saw that the car was already sold at the dealership. I was very frustrated hearing this since the only reason my car transaction was not moving was because the person I was working with was on vacation. I waited to hear back and when the person came back from vacation he told me he needed his manager to look into this. At this point I've already started my transaction a week and a half ago. His manager looked into it and said that they would make sure that the car was not sold to someone else. I was not feeling confident since there were so many reviews of this happening to people and being told they should pick another car. I decided to wait and a few more days and I got contacted by the contracting team. They had me sign a purchase agreement and all necessary documents. This is now 2 weeks after I started to purchase of the vehicle. Keep in mind that if you decide to do business with them it will be slow. I kept the transaction going with this car because I wanted the specific car due to the features, price point, and color. I've done business with Vroom and Carmax both online and you're able to get things moving the same day you pick a car. This was very unusual and a little stressful since I needed a vehicle due to moving. My assigned contracting employee was a game-changer. She was quick to respond, very friendly, and worked hard to make my transaction as painless and easy as possible. I would appreciate it if Driveway's management would reach out to me so I can let them know her name and what she has done for me. She was the reason that I was happy to walk away from my experience. I would have given this review 5 stars if it wasn't for the start of getting this transaction going. I think it would be best if Driveway had a better flow and security for getting their vehicles sold. Customers do not like hearing that their $500 deposit has no basis to hold the vehicle, especially when it is not their fault that they cannot purchase it the same day. Overall, I would consider doing business again with Driveway but only if I want a specific vehicle. I'd rather buy from Carmax.", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Get what you want not just whats available but be patient!", "text": "My experience with Driveway.com was very good overall. I was looking for a specific vehicle at the price I wanted to pay but I couldn't find it at the local car lots. They had vehicles available on their lots but not the one I was looking for. I started looking online and found Driveway.com. I was amazed with the vast selection available. I used their filter to narrow down what I was looking for and found several close ones.  I continued monitoring their site over time and finally there it was the one that everything I was looking for.  Traditional vehicle shopping at a car lot is usually spontaneous and reactionary. You test drive something that is available and then want to drive it home a couple of hours later.  Using Driveway.com I knew it would take time and this was difficult for me but it was the right thing to do and get what I really wanted. The vehicle I purchased from Driveway was an Out-of-State vehicle for me. This took more time to get delivered, then processing the registration took another couple of weeks. So I had to be patient, another difficult thing for me. In the end I have the exact vehicle I WANTED parked in my garage at a fair price.

Only to never receive it. I am now driving with an expired temporary tag. The dmv paperwork was not sent in for several weeks following the sale. This seems to be a common practice with Driveway. Despite this no one submitted for another 30 day tag. I have called several times to inquire about it. I've been lied to with the reassurance that someone would call the dealer and request it be emailed to me. NO ONE has called, NO ONE has emailed.  The urgency that was there before my money went into their hands, no longer exists. This is what irritates me the most. I have had to reach out to DMV myself. This is not something I've ever had to do in a car purchase. Like the saying goes \" you get what you pay for\". I am going on record in saying the following:1st. Purchase your vehicle locally if at all possible. Local dealers have to remain accountable. If they choose not to answer the phone,you can always pull-up to the dealer. Because of this, Ive never experienced anything like this in all my 50 years.The worst thing is that prior to receiving my money, Driveway was in constant contact. Now that they have the money...it's crickets. If I get a ticket and/or my insurance rate is impacted by this, Driveway will be paying it.Update: Rachel with the resolution department did reach out to me a few days later. She was delightful. She tracked the entire process from the point of her contacting me, until both my temp tags and permanent tags arrived.  Also, the 1st gentleman I reached had apparently started the process, I appreciatehis help also. The only employee I had a bad experience with was Ranisha, and fortunately the others made up for her.

The outcome was a loaner vehicle that I can use until my permanent plates come in. It was delivered to my home. I didn't expect this and I think he went above beyond to rectify the issue.

I can't understand why a big business like this can't get their stuff together. They give these fake insincere apologies and they really could care less after you have signed on the dotted line.My temp plates expired on 7/8/2023, but at least 2 weeks up to the expiration I reached out numerous times and never got a definitive answer as to what is the hold up. I finally spoke to someone today 7/11/23 and was told because of some supposed error on their end, my plates will not be available until 6-7 weeks from 7/7/2023. In good faith  I gave my deposit, got all of the paperwork done expeditiously , so there wouldn't be a holdup. They keep giving some bogus excuse of it being because it's out of state. The vehicle was from NJ and I live in Pa. It was from Eatontown Ford in Eatontown NJ. Got the vehicle without the remote start that was advertised in listing. All of the wheel sensors were bad(which after a few days- Driveway did replace ) and the vehicle had cosmetic issues and reekes of cigarettes. Every time I went in the vehicle I got a headache and a tingling on my tongue. They never detailed the car or noted that it was received from a very heavy smoker . I've purchased vehicles out of state before without this issue. The lack of follow-up is ridiculous. I'm still waiting for a key fob that I still haven't received. So now, I can't drive my car and I have no way to get to work and they expect my payment and I'm paying insurance. All they can say is it's out of their hands, you know what -- so is the car payment. Horrible , lack of follow up and no accountability. Pass the buck company. Everybody needs to be fired ! I filed a complaint with my  states Attorney General and will file one in their state .  In reading the reviews , I see this a reoccurring issue, which smells of fraud. Just like Carvana .As you can see by their textbook response - no real answer. They had more than 2 weeks and according to their rep, she said an error was made which pushed back my registration 6-7 weeks from 7/7/23. It was recorded, so I'll be requesting that transcript. They always say the same rehearsed lines, just changing out the name. How come everybody is experiencing the same delays?

It really has been a nightmare and a dream come true. See how.. PS -You\u2019ll need patience, prayers, and alternate means of transportation\u2026", "text": "I had a lot of problems and it took me a few days shy of 150 days to get hard plates for the vehicle. 6 months ago I bought the vehicle. Got the tags today. It only took me one attempt with my down payment ($500) and inventory.Some people would say run, however based solely on my experience I would say tread lightly, the vehicle was overall a good deal and in great condition..Breakdown in communication full spectrum, primarily all of which is done through email chain, call centers, and 3rd party companies.Rewind:Nor driveway or five64 asked for my POA or the car inspection until nearly 90 days had passed since buying the car..I pestered them eternally despite their continued negligence.I then had to do 3 notarized POAs due to various issues, despite me correctly filing out the first one correct they somehow lost (they claimed I didn\u2019t need to fill out the top portion - which I wouldn\u2019t have if it had been properly communicated to me in the first place). The third POA was necessary thanks to a notary error with the second one.On top of having to go through all this, I was now tasked to go to the BMV, for the vehicle inspection that wasn\u2019t done. The BMV, incorrectly sent me to the title agency, where I waited cramped for nearly 3 hours only to find out they couldn\u2019t help me since driveway had not sent any information to BMV, the BMV sent me there not understanding I intended to let the nearly hopeless 3rd party \u201cFive64\u201d procure them.Naturally, the vehicle also had a common issue / code with the model / year within the 2nd day of taking possession. Maybe I\u2019m a pre-cog clairvoyant man, because the night before they delivered it I dreamed it had a $600 repair and I made them take care of it, the reality was not far off. ($706.32), and I had to argue with the Chevrolet dealership about lowering the bill the second time around since it was their fault I was back again for the same issue.. A piece of rubber was lodged inside thermostat, which it to stay open, causing multiple other issues with the vehicle. First (Chevrolet) incorrectly replaced the coolant thermostat sensor The problem was causing battery drain (fan running after vehicle turned off due to safety feature to keep from overheating), not allowing functionality of the A/C (or heat), and caused me a LOT of stress, and time consuming visits to the Chevrolet dealership..Driveway and Five64 made me so angry I tried everything from threatening legal action and consumer protections and actually getting smart with employees. I don\u2019t like to be this way as it\u2019s not my nature and I found it very disheartening that this coupled with persistently pestering their customer service reps proved to be the ONLY way to get results..Furthermore, we even had problems with the guys delivering the car, since they tried to deliver it to the wrong house at a faraway street and neighborhood.. AND they drive the vehicle from wherever it gets hauled to for \u201csafety inspection\u201d. So ~150+ extra miles. But it came with a full tank..Purchased a 2011 Chevy Equinox LT1 AWD with 72K for under $13K delivered to the door. I am grateful, and possibly gray haired now from the process. How fitting that the tags would show up on Friday the 13th.. It really has been a nightmare and a dream come true. Literally.Driveway really needs more honest open clear communication and timelines..I am not sure if there is legality problems with their practices in regards to plate procurement. The lawyers were about hopeless too. Probably not worth protracted arbitration..I am totally averted to buying cars online now.Carvana is not worth the markup & lies, they approved me fully but I backed out because it was a bad deal and then they had the nerve to pretend to have denied me in the first place. Carmax however did not give me any issues in person several years ago. The experience was \u201clackluster\u201d however the car itself in some ways exceeded my expectations.Also was not provided with a temp tag. I was able to procure one on my own, so that eased the pain a little \u2014 I guess.", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Driveway did the right thing", "text": "Update: Driveway reached out and offered to refund the shipping fee due to the omission of the damages on the vehicle I was buying. Driveway started out great. Gave me a great offer for my trade. My vehicle was shipped to a local Driveway hub where I went to inspect it. Deep paint scratches to two doors, poorly touched up, Worn Bridgestones on the rear paired with two new low end Goodyears on the front, a damaged side step they tried to blame the  carrier, who had proof that it was damaged at pickup, rear seat leather was badly worn and a new Ford Battery was installed that was much smaller and lower than recommended CCA for this Lexus V8. Im out $500 to ship the vehicle after I foolishly took the word of the dealership that there were no issues with the vehicle. I asked for pics before the vehicle shipped that were not taken.

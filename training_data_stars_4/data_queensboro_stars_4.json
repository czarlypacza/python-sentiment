I received my order acknowledgment and the \u201cship date\u201d was a couple days before my \u201cneed date\u201d so I contacted on line customer service as it is so hard to get a real person on the phone any more. I simply asked if I could pay to get my shipment upgrade to an overnight delivery to insure I would have them on time? The on line customer service replied and stated that the \u201cship date\u201d is not guaranteed and is an estimate\u2026and then stated they could not change the shipping to overnight. Then they asked if I wanted to cancel or proceed with my order? Almost seemed as though they did not want my business anymore? I told them to move forward with the order but frankly I was not very happy with their answers or customer service and would think twice about placing future orders with them. Less than a week after I confirmed to move forward with the order I get another email stating my entire order was now 3 days ahead of the \u201cschedule date\u201d and that it would be shipping priority overnight at no additional expense to me. Guess maybe Fred Meyer or someone within the organization was made aware of my discontent and made an effort to make a 20+ year customer happy.

On January 2nd, I call customer service to inquire about my order.  I was told there was some damage done and quality control requested a few items to be reproduced due to the threading not being up to standard.  I was also told they were waiting on a couple more items to be completed.  I understand with the holidays to be backed up, but my order just came in today and not only is it 9 days late, one of my orders is missing! 5 weeks for an order is simply too long for my business to wait for products and items are missing.I am undecided if I will order again due to the time it takes to get the products delivered, and also, the stitching is inconsistent in quality on this order.  I just downgraded my review to 1 star since items are missing even after I called to check on the delay.  Not good.***UPDATE***Customer service called to talk about my experience and made me feel a lot better about Queensboro.  Not only do they stand behind their products, but they also assured me the entire order will be replaced no questions asked.  They made no excuses and explained how things like this can happen.

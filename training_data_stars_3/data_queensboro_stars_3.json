The same for the quality of the men\u2019s long-sleeve tee shirt which is the basis for my order.The quality of the embroidery is very disappointing.  Queensboro is not capable of providing all of the colors of the official logotype which I provided.  The embroidering equipment does not seem to reproduce the text of the logotype (letter J looks like the letter I) or to be able to follow the fine detail of the artwork of the logotype.I find the search capability of the Queensboro web site to be virtually useless.  I proposed to try the same logotype with screen printing instead of embroidery, but the only options (which Bobbie W. was able to find for me) required larger minimum quantities than I needed.

Another order 1865229, mind you, of 4 shirts ONLY, took 6/6-6/24. I'm sorry, but as a business owner, I can not trust the Queen. The order is always perfect once received.

I have one problem with Queensboro:  it is very difficult to find the fabric content of their shirts in their online descriptions, and fabric content is very important for comfort.  I want to order shirts made mostly with cotton.  On some of the items, like their \"cotton t-shirts,\" the fabric content is in the name of the item, but otherwise, it's very hard to find the right product.  On the polo shirts that I ordered, I tried to guess that \"silk touch\" would be made with some cotton.  They're just so-so.  Yes, the order is the way I placed it, so I can't say they made my order wrong, but I don't love the fabric.  It feels like mostly nylon or some other polyester fabric and they won't be comfortable like cotton would be.

After 4 weeks of no word about my order I began to get worried. So I try to log in to my account at night but can't because Queensboro is closed. I do so the next am to find a shirt is on backorder. Well I figure that explains the delay so I give it another week. No word so I contact customer service...no mention of the backordered shirt business when I ask about the delay  but here's where it gets sketchy. I'm told a machine went down and there order processing was affected and they are running behind but are back up after purchasing another machine. Ok I understand. Another week and no shirts. I contact them again and am told now that my order went to machine and that a shirt got damaged in production and that my shirts will be done that day or next and ship out. I'm really questioning the info now. I got shirts finally later than they again said but what gets me is that I felt like Queensboro was not telling me the truth. If there was a production issue, it would have been better to just announce it apologize and move forward.

I even called up Queensboro and asked if I could get one person assigned to my account, as I was trying to firm up the embroideries (and I am sorry but one was simple and yet, took them forever to get it right), but was almost laughed at. As I starting dealing with that rep back and fourth via e-mail, once again it took forever. As time went on, I ultimately had to fire Queensboro from ordering hundreds of shirts and go with a vendor that was more prompt. I am sorry but almost a month to get the embroideries (2 of the 3 were really simple) was unacceptable and I thought by using Queensboro, I could really impress my boss. Unfortunately I was wrong. After a while even he was like what the fudge?!Queensboro may be good if you have a small order and a very simple logo......but I would not recommend them if you are looking for good Customer Service to work with you on a potential large order as you will be dealing with numerous people along the way. I will also say they are able to get their shirts at discount because they are using old discontinued shirts (mine were Nike) - which if you go out and try on a Nike XL here, with them, it would basically be a size XXL as Nike has adjusted their fitting over the past few years.

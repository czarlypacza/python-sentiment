Ebay now offer us private collectors zero fees (as from 1st October) so it is vital you improve payments and bother to answer emails more quickly than days as current.Please could you kindly now ensure I get paid for the above transaction as the customer received the watch Monday and authorised payment.Thank you and what a shame a good platform is let down so badly by slow payments. In this day and age money transfers take minutes/hours not days.

As one of the world's biggest sites for pre-owned watches, the selection on offer is very good \u2014 and their escrow payment service makes transactions safe and easily handled. All good so far.Where Chrono24 falls short is on communication, fees and \"sales tricks\".1. Commission They charge a 6.5-8.5% fee on transactions \u2014 resulting in exorbitant fees on more expensive watches, when all they really do is offer a decent platform and a holding account for transactions. That's too much, and they are ripe for more competition because of this.2. ValuationsIn your so-called \"watch collection\" (a list of the watches you own), Chrono24 will value your watch at a certain price, which may lead you to think it has gone up in value. But when you actually go to sell it, Chrono24 recommends it goes on the market for a much lower price. As an example, a watch \"valued\" at 11,500 was a minute later recommended by Chrono24 to go on the market for 9,400, when I went to sell it. This reflects very badly on Chrono24.3. CommunicationYou can contact Chrono24 via various forms on the site, but I am yet to receive an answer to any of my questions. I have written them three times.4. Currency exchange ratesChrono24 will user their \"own\" currency exchange rate if you, say, accept an offer made in British pounds. Chrono24 will always want payment in Euro, which is fine, but you will pay a premium of around 2.5% for Chrono24 to settle with the seller in another currency. Chrono24's incurred fees when paying the seller in, say, pounds will by much, much smaller, so this is a \"hidden\" fee on top of the already high fee. Very poor service.5. On-site marketing spamThe platform will bombard you with pop-ups asking you to create \"alerts\", review sellers etc. etc. while you are browsing. You can close them, but on the next page load another one will load. It is quite absurd and significantly detracts from the experience on their site.  In sum, it's an efficient platform for its purpose, and since it's so dominant on the market, it's hard to avoid it if you are into watches.

But later on Cgrono24 starts to ask questions like 'did you buy this watch?' and later on pushes you to 'add watch to the collection'. Yep, as if I'd bought 5 same models. Interface and the whole thing is done in such a way that you're pushed to press 'yes', especially if you're not extremely attentive, as if some KGBguy on the other side tries to catch your lies. That way they try to figure out if you've bought the watch not through Chrono24. This is completely stupid and frustrating. Not even sure what would happen if I'd press 'yes' occasionally, since I did bough 1 watch out of possible 5 options, s the question with a photo 'did you buy this watch?' is not about 'did you use THIS dealer?'.Also at times Chrono24 does make phonically to ask if you bought a particular watch and this is over the top. They do not set up a call with you on agreed time. As if it is hard to assume that somebody who is buy-in a luxury expensive watch might have a tight schedule. Once I was called almost during the other meeting and even though I did point it out to a lady that I am busy she just pressed on more aggressively if I did do a purchase!!! Who came up with idea that it is a good way to talk to customer in such way in a field of luxury watches? There are other little things here and there which are strange, like if a dealer is impolite, or does something odd, you cannot do anything if you did not purchase a watch. This is stupid as well.

The process of purchasing was efficient and easy to navigate the website to connect me with the right buyer who had the watch I wanted,.  If fact, I am currently wearing the first watch I purchased using Chrono24\u2019s website. However and sadly, my second purchase shortly thereafter was not a pleasant experience, primarily due to the dishonest nature and the vendor misleading me about the watch.  I\u2019ve been collecting watches for over 30 years and this is the first time I\u2019ve ran into challenges with someone that was quite slick and did not fully disclose issues that any buyer should be informed of prior to purchasing a watch even after I asked a number of times.  He clearly stated to me the watch was in \u201cPerfect\u201d working order and will come 100% complete.  After I gave this vendor a negative review, he contacted me immediately in an unprofessional manner and was in fact quite angry.  Trying to coerce me into changing my negative review.  There was a difference of opinion. However, at the end of the day, this vendor did Not fully disclose issues with the timepiece or missing bracelet links even after I specifically asked if the watch will come complete with \u201cEverything\u201d\u2019, as if i were to purchase the watch new.  Upon the timepiece arrival, the Chronograph was not functional and bracelet links were missing.  When I inquired, his comment was \u201cWell, I received it that way\u201d and \u201cThe Chronograph must have been damaged during shipping.\u201d That is definitely misleading the buyer.  As a long time collector we want the watch complete ie. No missing parts.  To top it off, I had to have the watch I just purchased be completely repaired and serviced by the manufacturer.  He claims the watch Chronograph was functioning perfectly prior to shipment and it must have been damaged during shipment,  I\u2019ve owned  many Chronographs over 3 decades, so I understand what kind of motion can damage a Chronograph.  The package delivered did not have a single mark or dent in the corrugated box.  The watch inside the watch box was vacuumed seal in a suspended position away from the outer box walls again with the outter box zero signs of dents or even scratches.  My point being that this timepiece Chronograph complication was not functioning properly prior to shipping.  In the end, I have a watch I had to pay extra to have it serviced and now missing links which cannot be found as the watch was a limited production of only 250 pierces.  If I want to obtain the correct number of links would require me to purchase a brand new bracelet at approximately $1,500!  After this fiasco, I did not want to speak to this dealer any further.  Again, to make matters worse the retaliation after my negative review just made me feel uncomfortable.  Basically, indicating he did nothing wrong and we should correct the problem in order for me to remove my negative review.  He claimed to want to help resolve AFTER my negative review.  Who in their right mind would want to do further business with a misleading dealer, just so he can rid of my negative review?

Since there is a headquarters in New York City this is less clear for US buyers. The fee was only 50 US dollars but it was something that was unexpected. When I emailed Chrono24 regarding this issue all they said was take it up with my bank since they charged the fee.

Also, Chrono24 is a one-stop shop for a world of watches! But much more is needed to be done in terms of having sellers market their watches properly. The base template and product description for watches displatyed is greatly flawed. Sellers often have no idea what they are selling and cannot input accurate information. For instance, when filtering through the search fields for a watch of a particular size, almost half the quantity of watches are grouped in the 'no details' part. This field should be easiest to determine as all you need to do is take a metic ruler to the watch case and measure. This is much easier than determining the era that the watch was produced in for example. So really, Chrono24 needs to crack-down on the accuracy of information provided by the seller and really hold them to a higher level of accountability. The consequences for not are that a buyer can request a refund based on a watch sold with innaccurate information - and I'm sure this happens more than Chrono24 would like to admit. Anyways, this really needs to be addressed because buyers like myself shouldn't have to rant about issues like this.

In this way, when I notify acceptance of the watch, they can release the funds to the Seller ... this is a fairer process for both Buyer and Seller.Perhaps the 14 day wait period is easier for Chrono24 because it requires no action by them, and money in escrow account can earn interest during the entire transaction process, and that interest is paid to Chrono24 ???", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Marketplace should require consistency\u2026j", "text": "Marketplace should require consistency in the info they require dealers and sellers to include.

However, I did feel as if Chrono24 could have done more to help by trying to sort out a solution for me when I first contacted them as this is what should be expected. They do have a great website though and are definitely a good price to find the best offers on watches and I\u2019m sure if worst came to worst they could have refunded my money for the watch I bought, but I just thought that maybe more could have been done on their behalf to help resolve my situation.", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Slow communication", "text": "Slow communication.

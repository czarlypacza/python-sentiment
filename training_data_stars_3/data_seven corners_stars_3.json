She eventually tried some other method in which she had to manually enter the billing address before it finally worked. The whole time she blamed my bank saying that she thinks my bank was lying to me and that they probably just didn\u2019t raise my spending limit until right at that moment.

I bought a bare bones policy strictly to cover the new Covid-19 insurance mandates and meet the requirement for my host country (Argentina).  My gripe is with the \"Declaration\" or \"Confirmation\" page that I was to present as proof of my purchase.  Instead of stating that the coverage was for Covid, quarentining, hospital, ER, etc., it was a tick list highlighting what I DIDN'T purchase - all of the extras I didn't opt for - cancellation insurace, flight reimbursement, hotel costs, etc. etc. etc.  There was a slight mention of \"Covid\" at the bottom of the initial paragraph, and nothing else.  It was underwhelming.  When I talked to the agent again, she mentioned that I could \"upgrade\" (appx. $100 more) to a similar policy that actually 'highlighed' the policy as Covid Insureace (in the page header, the narrative, etc.  She offered the upgrade as I seemed disappointed with the policy I had purchased.  I explained that I was quite happy with the policy - it suited all of my needs.  The problem was with how they presented it - the declaration buried the Covid coverage, the 'upgrade' would highlight Covid coverage for a vastly increased premium.

During my time traveling, I had three minor medical issues, all of which I decided to pay out of pocket due to the ease and cost of payment. Given that, I did not need to utilize the insurance at all. There were several components of Seven Corners policy that were attractive features for me, and several that I felt I wish were better. (+) Cost is affordable! Compared to many options on the market, this is a good price for emergency coverage. The price was right in mid-range of what I found on the market.(+) You can buy last minute. For several people traveling with me, they ran into issues with other companies not having bought \"in time\" (more than two weeks prior to departure), whereas this was not an issue with Seven Corners.(-) Length of policy. I was not allowed to buy a policy that extended the entire length of my trip. I believe that the coverage had a 3 or 4-month max, and then you had to buy a second policy. This may work if you are traveling places with guaranteed internet, but if you are traveling in remote areas, this can be a huge hassle. (Not to mention, if you are out climbing mountains, \"I think my insurance policy runs out tomorrow\" is probably not the first thought in your mind.\" The option for longer-term policies would be much appreciated and something I would look for specifically in the future! (-) In regards to the point above, I received no reminder email from Seven Corners stating that the policy would run out in a week or even a few days. Only an email on the date it ended. I would definitely recommend this as an easy fix to Seven Corners to improve Customer Satisfaction and ensure that their clients have continued coverage!Overall, it was there for backup emergencies if needed (luckily, did not) and I would use them again in the future for shorter travel.", "rating": 3}, {"title": "lele", "text": "It was nice to have Japanese customer service\uff01", "rating": 3}, {"title": "You guys very much care for there\u2026", "text": "You guys very much care for there customers.", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Health Insurance", "text": "getting Policy Process is Good But Expensive.", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Poor customer service, (Addendum, Pandemics not covered)", "text": "Poor customer service. I was in Hong Kong, and wanted to leave early do to the concerns about the new corona virus, and flights being cancelled.At the time the state department had just issued a level 3 travel advisory due to the virus. I called to see if my medical insurance would cover flight change fees or evacuation due to the travel advisory. My customer service rep kept talking about level 3 or 4 travel advisory due to terrorism and said that would be covered, but that a level 3 or 4 travel advisory due to the epidemic would not be covered. This made no sense. Either the insurance is worthless or the customer service agent didn't know what she was talking about.Addendum: Seven Corners got back to me quickly, so I raised my rating to 3 stars.  They confirmed what the customer service rep told me, that level 3 or 4 political travel advisories are covered, but health travel advisories are not covered even though I bought travel health insurance. They told me that evacuation or flight change fees due to an epidemic are not covered, even with a level 4 travel advisory. They confirmed that medical care if I got sick in China would be covered. Medical evacuation would be covered if I was hospitalized while traveling, and they determined the care I was receiving was substandard. (Don't die while waiting for this determination)According to Forbes,many travel insurance policies exclude coverage due to epidemics and pandemics, so I rate seven corners average in this regard.  I think Seven Corners should make this clear to people before they buy a policy, and let people know if there is a premium policy upgrade which will cover travel changes due to a new level 3 or 4 health travel advisories.  I buy insurance to cover me for an unexpected emergency, I would consider a pandemic due to a previously unknown virus to be exactly the reason why I buy insurance!In my case I paid the airline change fees and left early.

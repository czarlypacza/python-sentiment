Upon delivery, I called customer service to discuss the damage to my product and was placed on hold for well over 20 minutes.  Once I was able to speak with a customer service representative, the issues was still left unresolved.  Once I was given an offer to compensate for the damages, it was unacceptable.

The ship was promised for 2 different times, then delayed. The trucker who finally delivered the steel table and sink was very good to deal with, fortunately, after the previous aggravation. He offered to open the box when I said I wanted to inspect the merchandise and waited patiently while I looked it over to be sure there was no visible damage and that a table, 4 legs, sink, and faucets were included. I highly recommend you contact UPS and be sure reps know that to immediately put the customer in contact with UPS Freight rather than regular UPS if it is a large package.

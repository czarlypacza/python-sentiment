I have purchased many products from this company and most have been very good. My fav all time is the Pine Pollen Tincture when the Tincture looked more like the Pine Pollen Powder. This last batch was definitely not my favorite as it tasted and looked more akin to alcohol than the Pine Pollen Tincture that I am come to know from this company so not so happy with the product this time which is why I going with 3 STARS. I much prefer my PPT to look like the Pine Pollen Powder which has a yellowish hue to it as well as the flavor. I do prefer all my tinctures to be alcohol based, but I should not taste the Grain Alcohol as if I am drinking a bottle of Smirnoff's without anything else. The results may indeed about the same in the end, but my preferences still stand. That stated, I prefer this company over many others because they know what honor and integrity is. They also listen to what their customers suggest for new ideas and enact upon them as soon as they can. I rate this company a 5 STAR overall. I much prefer people and companies that have Integrity especially since we as customers do not see anything but the end product so trust is a very important factor with me.

They always address a question as \"see you health care provider\", which is BS in my opinion. In fact, I no longer call or post, LEH I haven't for over a year and my purchases have also gone way down.  I think you need more specific information on dosing, telling someone use about 30 drops under the tongue is good for who? A 18 year old or a 90 year old person. I know you don't have the time, or possibly the resources to \"treat\" all your customers. I believe you guys truly, work very hard, to help people, so why drop the ball at dosing? I think if you used statements like if your over 65 you should consider 40 drops a day, or if you weight is above 180lbs you should use x. I believe these statements are broad enough so you wouldn't be blamed with \"prescribing\".Here is an example. I'm 65, and I take testosterone injections and  If I want to go only natural to lower my estradiol as a result of the testosterone injection, how many drops of SN should I take?  But if you stated in the website that men on testosterone replacement found help at 100-140 drops a day was helpful at lowering estradiol you would be ok as far as \"prescribing restrictions go\". By offering that guidance, I could then go to and get a blood draw after a week or 10 days of that guidance and see where my estradiol is and I could dial it in from there. Your broad statement just gave me a place to begin, that's all we need. Those of us who try do do everything natural need all the help we can get and we will pay what it costs to get the help we need But, it's also true if we don't get  the help we seek we will just continue to look until we find a place we can get it.I believe these statements are broad enough to keep you and your business out of trouble and still help your clients. Additionally, no matter how many customers you have now, if you gave that extra \"personal\" touch in the website description you would have a more dedicated customer base and frankly we could use the help. I think you guys in natural healing think we actually have an alternative source to help us, most of us don't we're on our own to prevent, heal and get cured.Also, it's nice way to build a loyal client base.Good luck!Thom", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Too soon to give a full review.", "text": "Date of experience: March 29, 2018", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Perfectly adequate.", "text": "Date of experience: February 27, 2020", "rating": 3}]

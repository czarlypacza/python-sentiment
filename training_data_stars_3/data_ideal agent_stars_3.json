She had the contract and all other paperwork drawn up within a couple days and thanked us for letting the buyers in stating that we would pay the reduced commission since no other realtor was involved. However, when reviewing the closing statement we noticed she gave the lawyer her statement at 3.5%. She did correct it after we disputed it.

Interestingly, the buyer's agent got 2.5% so maybe that was part of his problem too.  I don't know. Also, there are a lot of people that contact you for information that they are going to supposedly pass on to the buyer, but in my case, that didn't happen.  I provided names and contact info for services, i.e. electric, etc., but the buyer was never given the info. Finally, the last straw was finding out late Thursday that closing was going to be Monday, so we had three days to get out of the house! And that was AFTER I had questioned my agent as to when closing was. He did NOT provide a definitive date and gave me a wishy-washy answer! I was truly appalled at that. Literally on Monday we were moving things out the back door while the new owner was moving in the front door.I would NEVER wish any of my bad experience with \"Ideal Agent\" on anyone else so, BEWARE and always know that because your listing agent is getting paid way less than what he would normally get, you will fall to the bottom of their priority list!", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Arduous", "text": "It took 7 months to sell my condo, much longer than expected.

We felt valued as sellers while working up to a ratified contract and after felt more like nuisances than clients. Our selling agent seemed to not put the work in that was needed to close on time. We closed a day shy of the buyer being in breech of contract. Sure the market is crazy at the moment but we did not feel like we had a \"team\" working for us, we got a lot of \"your agent is the only one who can help with that and they're in a meeting\" when attempting to get answers and a solid timeline. We were happy to get to closing, despite the lack of information and effort given as to the closing delay from our \"ideal\" agent.

They are a company that wants to do the right thing.  It all comes down to the agent that you sign to sell your home.  Mark C our agent in Phoenix was nothing short of Mr Personality while trying to get our listing.  Once he got our listing he became Mr ImRightYourStupid.  We have bought and sold many houses over the last 40+ years and this is the worst real estate experience we have ever had.  Our conflicts with Mark C brought him to suggest we cancel our contract with him.  We agreed and placed a formal request to cancel.  Then Mark C wanted us to pay him thousands of dollars to get out of the contract or he would tie up our home for 6 months.  We should have contacted Ideal Agent and I believe they would have step in for us but we did not.  We ended up taking a contract that was 20-30 thousand less than what our property should have sold for just to get rid of Mark C.  Sometimes you get what you pay for.  In our case we got a lot less.

Liked agent they recommended but chose another  at Sotheby\u2019s who worked more in our price range.  Jon at Ideal asked where we were headed (Duluth MN) and referred us to Ben Funke, a GREAT Remax agent who helped us buy the house we really wanted in a pretty strong seller\u2019s market.  He helped us develop a strategy that got us the house over six other offers without paying much over initial asking price.     As buyers, there was no financial benefit to use Ben (I.e., reduced commission).  But we were glad to meet and use him.  By the referral agreement, Ben paid Ideal a sizable share of his commission.  Here is my problem with Ideal.     Our son and family are also buying a home in Duluth.  They were interviewing two other agents here when we told him what good luck we had with Ben.  They hit it off with Ben as well.  I never mentioned Ideal.  Jon at Ideal called last week asking for our feedback on Ben and we raved about him.  I also mentioned that Ben did a great job finding a home for our son.  The next day Ben gets a call from an Ideal rep saying that they expected to be paid the same percentage of his commission on that sale as well when it closes in June!  WHAT?      This seems inherently unfair.  How far does this daisy chain stretch, to my grandkids?  I am happy for the referral to Ben but cannot recommend using them because of how they treat their agents.  Consider a sliding scale bite per additional referral within some reasonable time frame, not in perpetuity.

I was quoted that we would be able to consolidate 6 of my current bills into the loan. After the assessment of my property was done we could only do 2 at most, and that wasn't even guaranteed. I was told that based on what was in on my credit that my house was put up as collateral and had a lean on it from a 10k loan for my roof. I am not stupid and would not do something like that. I had to jump through hoops to show that it wasn't when all that was needed was a title search to ensure that there were no liens or anything of that nature, which was done later. I feel that the title search should have been done before even mentioning this, it would have saved some stress from happening. After that got cleared up I was able to add two things to my loan to get them off of me. I was not happy with a few things. the initial quote was based on a hope that my house would come out at 155k and we could take 6 total bills plus the house and consolidate them to make my life easier. I was looking forward on this and I had signed the documents for this. After my house was appraised it was only at 132k. As stated above this made things tighter and I could only put two things on the loan instead of six. In my honest opinion there should have not of been a quote at first, the appraisal should have been done and then the quote. This would have made it more practical and not got my hopes up that I was going to be able to get a lot of bills off of me. The process took a little more than a month to take place, the timing turned out to put me to a point where I had to make two payments on the bills that I was putting on this refinance. I was able to pull my account status offline but was not allowed to use that to show how much was owed as a new balance. This made no common sense, I wanted to make sure that I was not over paying the bills. This part in my opinion should have not had to wait for statements, the statements came from me printing them out from the same way that I printed out the account status earlier. Lastly: During this process I was required to get a termite inspection for the house. The company that did the inspection did not spell my last name right. It was not caught until the closing documents had been sent back to NewDay after I had signed them. I was called and emailed by Mr. Michael C. Coleman and told that I needed to resign the form the way that the termite company had put it on their form. This to me is unethical due to that not being my name at all. I understand that they had a section stating what my name could come out like at the beginning of the closing but if the name is wrong on the documents NO one should be told to sign incorrectly. It took a few hours and I had it corrected.\"Hi Mr. Kindley, We have a document that needs an easy correction for your loan to fund tomorrow. Just need you to print this out and add \u201cMichael David Kinley Jr\u201d on the first blank line and initial next to it.The termite inspector spelled your last name without the \u201cd\u201d so we need \u201cMichael David Kinley Jr\u201d added as a name variation.Thanks,Michael Christian Coleman II\u200bAssistant Vice President \u2011 Loan OriginationMLONMLS # 1788971Company NMLS # 1043\" I called and spoke with Michael Coleman's supervisor (Jacob Field) to express my concerns about the second two of my problems with this process and all he did was make excuses about how things were not in NewDay's hands to change or look at things in a different manner. Even told me that it was common place to have people sign how the forms state even if it isn't their names due to the start of the closing that it shows the variations of the names. I was not at all happy with Mr. Field's manner in taking care of concerns.", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Mostly positive experience with some avoidable frustrations", "text": "Overall, our experience has been positive, but we experienced some irritating, possibly costly problems.  Doing a refinance over the computer and the phone was an interesting experience. The application process went fairly rapidly, the appraisal scheduled quickly, and the signing with a local notary went well. The loan funded after the three day waiting period, and loan proceeds minus credit card payoff amounts were electronically transferred into our checking accountOur frustration came from credit card debt payoff.  In a past refinance (long before the computer age) our payoff to a credit card was paid directly to the creditor.  That did NOT happen this time. Checks made out to the creditors were issued on the loan funding date and then MAILED TO US WHICH REQUIRED US TO THEN MAIL THEM TO THE CREDITORS.  We were NOT informed that was your policy.  Had we known that, we would have had ALL payoff monies deposited to our checking account and could have made payoffs ourselves a LOT FASTER.  Both payoff checks were for incorrect payoff amounts (and overpayments) and we had to mail them to creditors (as they could not be processed at the store electronically).  Posting the payment will take 10-14 days after they receive it (one went to Florida from Idaho.)  The due date for a monthly payment will likely come before these checks are posted, and a refund received and deposited, so we will have to remit another payment to all three cards to avoid late fees and will accrue MORE INTEREST!  I (Lynette) had done a balance transfer of two credit card balances to a long-held credit card that had offered a 15-month ZERO % interest.  Just days after, husband Greg decided to do a refinance of our mortgage to do home improvements and he decided to pay off credit cards with loan proceeds.  The credit report that New Day pulled did not reflect the current correct balances of the original two cards and there was no record of the balance transfers to the third card.  Greg called with updated figures but they were not entered into your system. When Greg tried to call all day long one day to verify correct payoff information, his calls were not returned. The person assigned to our account while our loan person was out of the office simply ignored the calls and messages. That is poor customer service.So the loan funded with payoff checks that had incorrect payoff amounts. As a result, we now have to formally request a REFUND for each one after they finally post.  One company can do the refund as an electronic deposit to our checking account (which is estimated to take 3-4 days), but the other one only issues a check to be mailed to us, which will then take another 10-14 days to receive and then must be deposited into our checking account..  Because monies are tied up, we are unable to payoff the balance transfer credit card company. We will have to pay additional interest on two cards and possible late charges on all if another payment is not made on all THREE credit cards by their due dates.  So New Day may COST us money.  It's the principle of the whole situation that bothers us the most.  We did not receive good customer service; and, as a result, may incur additional interest costs we did not anticipate.This situation with payoff has made our whole experience frustrating.  We DO like the low interest rate, found the interaction with New Day loan people mostly positive, and are happy the loan funded so we can make home improvements and (eventually) pay off credit card debt.Because of our experience, we suggest your staff make your procedures for paying off credit cards VERY CLEAR to loan applicants so they don\u2019t run into the frustrations we did.  We believe it reasonable to assume you pay off balances directly and others may assume the same. Clear and complete communication is necessary for customer satisfaction.

SSubsequently things were worked out and we got all the funds we initially requested, and within the discussed time frames, so in that regard we are pleased.I would make  a few suggestions to a company which I believe has very good potential to be exemplary:- Those individuals dealing with customers with the ongoing requirements to complete the paperwork should have a checklist or \"cheat sheet\" that lists the stages and associated paperwork that must be completed in each respective stage, to include anything specifically mandated by VA requirements.- If there is a discrepancy, mathematical or otherwise, the representative should look into that potential error and then get back with the customer and explain it, either pro or con, rather than assume that the customer is wrong and is just not getting it.- Stating that the final numbers outcomes for the loan will not be available until the signing causes only problems at the signing; there were no real problems at our signing but only because we were diligent in finding out some answers prior to the agency bring the paperwork to the closing. All mortgage agencies have computer programs that can extrapolate those figures in advance so it should be a no brainer to provide to the customer something that is more accurate with no last minute significant surprises.Customer perceptions are their realities and good intentions can go only so far in terms of advancing goals of success in efforts made by any business.I know your efforts were sincere and we thank you for completing my VA loan which allowed us to pay off obligations and restructure our finances.", "rating": 3}, {"title": "once papers were signed no further \u2026", "text": "once papers were signed no further contact from new day regarding refunds or if questions. still waiting for refund of escrow 18 days later", "rating": 3}, {"title": "The application part went smoothly even \u2026", "text": "The application part went smoothly even with several last minute requests with days until closing.

That's seventy-eight days.I became frustrated.  The realtor became frustrated.  The title company became frustrated.  Various inspection services became frustrated.  The seller became frustrated almost to the point of backing out of the sale!There was no issue with my VA eligibility.  There was no issue with my credit, employment status, property appraisal, inspections or anything else.  So why did the process take so long and create so much frustration?  Certainly, I understand the requirements any lender will have for a buyer to provide evidence of financial stability.  In addition, the item being financed must prove to be of equitable value.  This is especially true in the case of a home mortgage.  Maybe it's even more true now in the wake of our bursting housing bubble in the U.S.  I get that...What I don't get is that with each piece of evidence I was asked for (and was able to provide same day in most cases but within 24 hours in all cases), why was it not possible for New Day to provide a comprehensive list of everything required so that I could submit it as a complete package for review.  Rather, one or two items would be requested and then a few days later one or two more items would be requested.  This dragged on for weeks.  After a while, some of the requests for items became duplicated and, in a few cases, the same documents were requested three different times.  Inspection reports were submitted only to find out later that a specific Form should have been used.  Why couldn't this have been mentioned in advance?  More time lost.  The Sales Agreement had to be revised numerous times.  I started to feel like my perseverance was being tested as part of the approval process.  Maybe it was but it almost cost me the home.

Refinancing a home is a big endeavor, and the customer should never be left wondering what is next, or why the process is moving slowly. In fact, we were given several closing dates, only to have them not materalize on those dates. Some of it was due to the underwriter which is always an unpleasant part of the process, but other parts was lack of communication with the loan officer.

NEWDAY let this slip through the cracks and now I am forced to pay for this huge repair on my own.  But I also think of what could have happened, what if I lost the home to fire in those days ......Total Loss and still have to pay my mortgage payment with nothing to cover it.  All because they never updated my homeowners start date.  I am very upset and now faced with going the legal route to recover my expenses.

Even after signing in again to see a difference. One last thing is on the wishlist it\u2019s hard to see everything because it\u2019s lined up in a row and this makes it difficult to decide what to get. I wish there were like rows of 3 so it would be easier to get to things. And also the wishlist should be organizable or filter able so things can be grouped together and make it easier to decide.  My favorite thing on the site is easy access and simple look of the guide to certain pages. I also like the red labeling on things on sale.  Though simplistic the webpage seems kind of boring for a place called rainbow. Some nice color schemes or unique effects can make the site seem more memorable.

When removing an item from the cart on both mobile & desktop, the images & description of remaining items in cart are not accurately displayed. i.e. the item image doesn't match the item description. This can cause items to be removed from the cart in error. To correct this issue I had to click the Cart icon, which updated the page.#2. This is an important one: Some type of Reward, discount, or other incentive should be offered to customers based upon the amount being spent, frequency of repeat shopping etc. Today, I spent over $500 with \"free shipping\" for my order meeting or exceeding $75. This is not a real incentive anymore due to nationwide shipping delays; even paying for expedited shipping doesn't mean items will be received as estimated. Side note: 2 of my orders were placed prior to 10:00 am est. today; it's now 8:45 pm est. & neither order has even been prepared for shipping. I know staffing is an issue everywhere; with that in mind, if orders placed & paid for prior to noon cannot be prepared for shipping the same day; having to meet a $75 limit to get free standard shipping that's going to take additional processing time prior to even being ready to ship, is not an incentive or reward to your customers.

Even after signing in again to see a difference. One last thing is on the wishlist it\u2019s hard to see everything because it\u2019s lined up in a row and this makes it difficult to decide what to get. I wish there were like rows of 3 so it would be easier to get to things. And also the wishlist should be organizable or filter able so things can be grouped together and make it easier to decide.  My favorite thing on the site is easy access and simple look of the guide to certain pages. I also like the red labeling on things on sale.  Though simplistic the webpage seems kind of boring for a place called rainbow. Some nice color schemes or unique effects can make the site seem more memorable.

When removing an item from the cart on both mobile & desktop, the images & description of remaining items in cart are not accurately displayed. i.e. the item image doesn't match the item description. This can cause items to be removed from the cart in error. To correct this issue I had to click the Cart icon, which updated the page.#2. This is an important one: Some type of Reward, discount, or other incentive should be offered to customers based upon the amount being spent, frequency of repeat shopping etc. Today, I spent over $500 with \"free shipping\" for my order meeting or exceeding $75. This is not a real incentive anymore due to nationwide shipping delays; even paying for expedited shipping doesn't mean items will be received as estimated. Side note: 2 of my orders were placed prior to 10:00 am est. today; it's now 8:45 pm est. & neither order has even been prepared for shipping. I know staffing is an issue everywhere; with that in mind, if orders placed & paid for prior to noon cannot be prepared for shipping the same day; having to meet a $75 limit to get free standard shipping that's going to take additional processing time prior to even being ready to ship, is not an incentive or reward to your customers.

At first I thought it was another cheap store with clothing that will shrink or rip after a few use. I learned that their clothes are long lasting and some items are nice and soft. I am older in my 40\u2019s so I do not agree with every style. I learned if I truly like something and it is tight, or cropped, I will get a bigger size. I wear a size large and often find myself buying 1x shirts for a good coverage. I am hoping that they will come out with a business line for some of us professionals. I also love the Black Pride for girls. I just think that most of the clothes are to \u201cgrownish.\u201d Girls are Princesses and their mothers are Queens. We must let them know that. We are raising future Queens, but for now, they must know their place. Calling an elementary girl a Queen might confuse her and she will think she is the \u201cboss of her household.\u201d This is promoting brattiness,  sassiness, rudeness, and disrespect toward the adult female. The images on the girl\u2019s outfit should show and promote innocence. It should show natural beauty rather than a black girl with red or bright pink lipstick/lipgloss. The images should promote natural beauty without makeup. I have a 7 year old and I teach her that she is beautiful without earrings and lipgloss. She understands that her natural glow pops because of her melanin\u2026no additives necessary. We do not want our little girls to become grown and a direct target for pedophiles. I am looking forward for a rebrand for our Princesses. Lastly, there are no rewards, points, or something extra for those of us who spend a good amount of money? This need to be incorporated. I often look for deals, if I find something similar and it has a reward program, I am most definitely buying from that store.", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Loyal Customers should get a percentage\u2026", "text": "Loyal Customers should get a percentage off not just around January of February....Just to get 5 or 10 dollars off.

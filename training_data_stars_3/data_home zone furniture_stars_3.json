", "text": "Let me start by saying the staff in the Burleson store are incredibly helpful and went above and beyond in moving things around to ensure all the colors matched. They also helped us with the best price we could get on the 2 couches and 3 tables and rug we purchased for our living room. Unfortunately the story only gets worse from there. The furniture arrived promptly when expected, however one of the couches was marked and messed up in multiple areas. It appeared it was either used or just poorly overlooked. The coffee table also had a board reversed on it showing the nail holes on just one board when it shouldn\u2019t have been. There was also a gap in parts of the wood that we were told on the phone shouldn\u2019t be there. After calling customer service and discussing it with them, they arranged for the defective pieces to be replaced. When the new couch arrived, it was in much better condition, and the table had all the boards the right direction this time. Unfortunately it still had the gap in the wood. We also noticed after comparing the new couch to the original couch that wasn\u2019t replaced that the arms were a different shape. The new arms were straight, and the original couches arms slanted. The stitching on the original couch also had uneven stitching. I know that it can come across as not picking, however when you spend over 5k on something you tend to expect a certain level of quality and quality control. This entered us into about a week long game of phone tag with customer service in which ultimately they didn\u2019t want to swap anything out any more, but also were initially going to charge us a 20% restocking fee. After discussing further with customer service they finally said that they couldn\u2019t really process the return and refund, and we would have to go to the store. Luckily, Jesse, the manager on duty, was fantastic. When we came into the store I\u2019m sure he could feel the frustration oozing off of us after the customer service run around. He helped us through the process and arranged for everything to get picked up and refunded. We were out the delivery fee, but that is far and beyond better than 20%. All said and done, is the main reason I\u2019m going with 3 stars. 5 stars for the local store and the staff. 1 star for the phone customer service and the quality control on this new line of furniture.

There was an issue where the screw coming off the leg in the middle of the sofa was too long and made a very loud noise as it scraped across one of the support springs. I cut it shorter with an angle grinder which fixed that problem, but I hope for greater quality when I pay a grand for something new.Then my wife and I have noticed that the buttons on the back (front of the back?) of the sofa are loosely connected, fragile, and pretty sharp on the back side. We haven't done anything crazy on the couch, just sitting and laying, but the buttons have very quickly gotten loose and can be pretty sharp if your arm rubs across them the wrong way.

Apparently VISA isn't everywhere I want to be or else Home Zone would've accepted my $500 VISA gift card, no doubt I'll remember that.2. Your delivery service isn't in any way related to Home Zone or at least didn't seem like it, they really didn't care about the furniture or giving me time to look over the furniture. They wanted a signature and they wanted to leave. I bet they didn't even know what furniture company they were delivery for. They just seemed like hired movers. No HZ uniforms no HZ truck.3. When I met the movers outside I noticed the furniture wasn't even wrapped or covered in the truck.4. Craftmanship was poor on one of my consoles, unlike the other console. The good news, it was a great experience with the exchange, at least on the phone, I'll be getting the exchange tomorrow, so we'll see if this one is better. Hopefully the delivery service doesn't throw it into my house and run away.These are not terribly BAD things, but things that made this experience average and nothing special, so if I could give it a 2.5 star I would.

However, it was a known fact that you have a fixed prices for the furniture on the showroom floor. Having said and agreed to purchase the living room sofa set salesperson did not have the complete set available to be delivered. I paid for the delivery charge, however, when you don't have in stock a given piece of furniture off of the set why would I have to pay for the left over piece when it comes in? My request to the sales manager was to deliver the piece when you get it. He insisted that when it comes in Home Zone will deliver sll pieces at one time with the one time delivery charge. That may take 6 weeks or more until then I will have to put up without the furniture or pay again to deliver. Seems absurd when you don't have in stock, but having paid in advance for the missing piece, I will be charged again for delivery. If my order was not in one package, I can under stand the extra charge to be paid. Hope you check this out and make some changes in how this issue will be handled in future. Its a matter of Home Zone's reputation and convenience to the customers. the reason given was we don't have a truck to deliver. Sure it doesn't sound right. A furniture store does not have a truck?

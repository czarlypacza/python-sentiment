", "text": "Let me start by saying the staff in the Burleson store are incredibly helpful and went above and beyond in moving things around to ensure all the colors matched. They also helped us with the best price we could get on the 2 couches and 3 tables and rug we purchased for our living room. Unfortunately the story only gets worse from there. The furniture arrived promptly when expected, however one of the couches was marked and messed up in multiple areas. It appeared it was either used or just poorly overlooked. The coffee table also had a board reversed on it showing the nail holes on just one board when it shouldn\u2019t have been. There was also a gap in parts of the wood that we were told on the phone shouldn\u2019t be there. After calling customer service and discussing it with them, they arranged for the defective pieces to be replaced. When the new couch arrived, it was in much better condition, and the table had all the boards the right direction this time. Unfortunately it still had the gap in the wood. We also noticed after comparing the new couch to the original couch that wasn\u2019t replaced that the arms were a different shape. The new arms were straight, and the original couches arms slanted. The stitching on the original couch also had uneven stitching. I know that it can come across as not picking, however when you spend over 5k on something you tend to expect a certain level of quality and quality control. This entered us into about a week long game of phone tag with customer service in which ultimately they didn\u2019t want to swap anything out any more, but also were initially going to charge us a 20% restocking fee. After discussing further with customer service they finally said that they couldn\u2019t really process the return and refund, and we would have to go to the store. Luckily, Jesse, the manager on duty, was fantastic. When we came into the store I\u2019m sure he could feel the frustration oozing off of us after the customer service run around. He helped us through the process and arranged for everything to get picked up and refunded. We were out the delivery fee, but that is far and beyond better than 20%. All said and done, is the main reason I\u2019m going with 3 stars. 5 stars for the local store and the staff. 1 star for the phone customer service and the quality control on this new line of furniture.

We haven't done anything crazy on the couch, just sitting and laying, but the buttons have very quickly gotten loose and can be pretty sharp if your arm rubs across them the wrong way.

They wanted a signature and they wanted to leave. I bet they didn't even know what furniture company they were delivery for. They just seemed like hired movers. No HZ uniforms no HZ truck.3. When I met the movers outside I noticed the furniture wasn't even wrapped or covered in the truck.4. Craftmanship was poor on one of my consoles, unlike the other console. The good news, it was a great experience with the exchange, at least on the phone, I'll be getting the exchange tomorrow, so we'll see if this one is better. Hopefully the delivery service doesn't throw it into my house and run away.These are not terribly BAD things, but things that made this experience average and nothing special, so if I could give it a 2.5 star I would.

However, it was a known fact that you have a fixed prices for the furniture on the showroom floor. Having said and agreed to purchase the living room sofa set salesperson did not have the complete set available to be delivered. I paid for the delivery charge, however, when you don't have in stock a given piece of furniture off of the set why would I have to pay for the left over piece when it comes in? My request to the sales manager was to deliver the piece when you get it. He insisted that when it comes in Home Zone will deliver sll pieces at one time with the one time delivery charge. That may take 6 weeks or more until then I will have to put up without the furniture or pay again to deliver. Seems absurd when you don't have in stock, but having paid in advance for the missing piece, I will be charged again for delivery. If my order was not in one package, I can under stand the extra charge to be paid. Hope you check this out and make some changes in how this issue will be handled in future. Its a matter of Home Zone's reputation and convenience to the customers. the reason given was we don't have a truck to deliver. Sure it doesn't sound right. A furniture store does not have a truck?

Being new to Waco and not having access to the Internet since I was only in town for that one day to look at a place for my mother to live, I am responding based on my limited experience at this time with the Waco store. Since I am new to Waco and am not familiar with places to shop for furniture, I just happened to drive by the store. I turned around and my mother and I went in to look at what they offer in products, their product-quality, and prices.First, I can only comment on the sales staff at this time. Both of us were impressed with the sales staff in the Waco store. My mother needed to purchase a bedroom suite and a bed. Anna B. was very knowledgeable about the furniture and thoroughly answered her questions. What I cannot comment presently regarding the Waco store is (1) the condition of the furniture when it is delivered and (2) whether it will be delivered when my mother needs it. I am concerned about the many, many negative comments about the customer service related to the Austin store. Fortunately, I did meet the Waco store manager and left with the impression that he is interested in satisfying the customer as well as meeting the company's sales objectives. What is to be seen is what will actually be his priority; will it be his customers' satisfaction or will it be the money?I am rather concerned that this company has not figured out how to combine both of them together. Alternatively, they have personnel issue(s) in Austin that need(s) to be resolved and they may not be acknowledging and/or addressing those problem(s).Hopefully, with the Waco store being under a different manager, it will not have the customer dissatisfaction that Austin has.My other concern relates to the fact that a store located in an area as large as Waco and its surrounding communities does not offer free delivery, but charges its customers a $99 delivery fee and THEN ONLY DELIVERS on three days during the week. If customers are paying for delivery, then shouldn't a customer's REASONABLE delivery request  be the first priority? There is possibly something off with the Home Zone Furniture focus  because they have given many people the impression that they are putting their needs (i.e., profits) BEFORE the needs, desires and/or expectations of their customers.  I think they have it backwards because if companies meet the needs, desires and/or expectations of their customers, then profit ALWAYS follows as long as other costs are managed and controlled, such as product quality, product selection and appropriate product pricing.Since I am moving my mother to Waco from another part of Texas, it is not convenient for us to drive three hours in order to be available and present when Home Zone Furniture decides they can deliver her furniture. If they do not deliver on the scheduled day or if the furniture is damaged and we do not accept it, I am stuck with paying for a hotel room or spending hours on the road driving back home only to turn around and do it all over again...at Home Zone Furniture's convenience. Timing is a critical issue for us and everything needs to work smoothly like the cogs of the wheels in a clock. I have major concerns about this, unfortunately, and I am waiting to see how well the Waco store will address any customer service issues we may possibly experience. Overall, I can only hope that I have not made a mistake purchasing from Home Zone Furniture and also that my mother and I will be pleased when her new furniture is delivered. We are both looking forward to her settling into her new home and are counting on Home Zone Furniture to help make that a reality for her.", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Installers scratched paint off of walls \u2026", "text": "Installers scratched paint off of walls in two places during delivery and set up.", "rating": 3}, {"title": "I spent a good deal of time identifying \u2026", "text": "I spent a good deal of time identifying the furniture I wanted for a new home.

(I was allowed to pull the fabric loose on the bottom of the furniture at HomeZone in order to inspect construction.) Our sales person, Lornah, was exceptional.  We had lots of questions and she had or found answers to all of them.  She seemed very honest too as her answers weren't all just to \"please the customer\".  The only \"friction\"  came on delivery day.  I had been told to expect a call around 10:30 a.m. to confirm that my furniture was available for pick-up.  I called the store at around 11:30 to ask why I hadn't heard anything yet and was told the truck had arrived late and hadn't been inventoried yet. (I asked to speak with my sales person and was told she wasn't available and that I was speaking to the manager and she could help me.) I was then told to expect a call within the hour.  At around 2:00 p.m.  I called again and asked to speak with my sales person and was denied the request again by the same manager who said she had completed all the calls for the day and my name was not on the manifest.  She continued to look and then found that my furniture was \"already here\" and that I was welcome to come pick it up.  I asked how long it had been there and why I hadn't received a call and all she could say was \"I understand your frustration.\"  This was unsatisfactory and really makes me hesitate to do further business here.

I wasn't sold on it at first but the more she told me about it, I fell in love. Unfortunately when we decided to get it, they were out and wouldn't get any for 3 weeks. I was VERY disappointed. We needed a couch now because we had none and sitting on the floor is not much of an option for me seeing as I have arthritis in my back and have spasms and sciatic nerve issues so I asked her if they would sell us the floor model. She asked her manager and he said no. I was very disappointed and just really didn't want to be there anymore. I saw another couch but I was just really sold on the Big Easy. I went home disappointed, sat on my floor and called another store out of town. I was willing to travel an hour and a half to get the couch I wanted but they were out to. They actually sold their floor model. I went on your website and looked into other options and found another I was interested in (not as much as the other but sitting on the floor for 3 weeks wasn't an option). We went back in and decided to settle for the other one but was also disappointed to find out that I would still have to wait about a week for that one to come in to!

We did my contract but I got a call that she forgot some paperwork and I had to go back and sign papers which is a little annoying that I had to drop what I had planned to go in, but at this point I needed a couch and I knew this was my only option", "rating": 3}, {"title": "No staff on hand", "text": "Once we finally found a sales person, we had to sit and wait another 15 minutes before another associate finally came out, except she didn't know we had been there for a half hour total waiting and asked to help another family that had come in not 5 minute before she came from behind her desk.  Not her fault, the store needs more staff on hand. She was very pleasent and helpful once we got to speak to her. We are pleased with our purchase but disappointed with the lack of staff.", "rating": 3}, {"title": "very good customer service", "text": "Very good customer service from Kali found exactly what I needed.", "rating": 3}, {"title": "couch quality", "text": "The loveseat was in a box and the arms have big dents in them.

We asked about the 90 days same as cash and neither salesman explained how it worked and that we would have to pay a $50 application fee. We got hit with that and also the fact that it would be financed through a 3rd party while we were being rung up. This is not the way to do business. Be up front and and honest to your customers. This info could be important when making a decision to purchase. Also the employees weren't very knowledgeable about the products they sell. We were told after the sale that the matrress wasn't in stock. Employees need to get their act together.", "rating": 3}, {"title": "First time visiting the round rock store", "text": "Very friendly and professional store representatives. No pressure whatsoever and more than happy to help . Store was nicely kept and decorated. Plenty of merchandise and not cluttered.

I need to make arrangements for my existing furniture before I make my purchase and he got me started on the paperwork so less fuss when I return to finalise the sale and set a delivery date. This was very easy and I look forward to purchasing my new living room set !", "rating": 3}]

My friends and I order this product together in a single 200 gram tub for all of us but we recently found another supplement manufacturer that has a lab certificate of analysis of over 99% pure that offers 200 grams for $50 or so as opposed to $80 dollars. Really like the large crystal form because it's easy to weigh out but this is getting ridiculously expensive for all of us to chip in on for a mood enhancer.", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Service is lacking recently", "text": "Initially, Liftmode always provided high quality service in general. Quick shipping, great support, and top quality products. They were highly reliable and, in my opinion, the best company to order supplements and nootropics from by far. If they supply something I need, I get it from them exclusively.However, I have had issues with both of my recent orders which makes me think this is now the norm. They were out of stock on nearly all types and quantities of the supplement I needed on my first order for a while. I waited a few days for any to be in stock but had to compromise on my preference in product as I didn't want to wait longer.Things got worse with my most recent order. I didn't receive one of the items I purchased because it became out of stock after I ordered. I contacted support and was told it was on backorder and I would receive it as soon as it was available. That was on October 13. More than two weeks later I have yet to receive the item I paid for, nor have I been contacted with an update or any related information on this issue.Because of my previous positive experiences with Liftmode I trusted all would be resolved after I contacted support so I've waited without contacting support about this again.Overall I still think Liftmode is the best company to get your supplements/nootropics from and I'll continue get my things from here exclusively.

One of the mens chains l got was smaller then what I expected. My husband didn\u2019t like it so I kept it for myself.

Also, I wrote a few times asking if I had to pay shipping every single time and no response. I feel like if you want to keep people as ambassadors then we shouldn\u2019t have to pay for anything.

I would say some of the items I received definitely look nice to the eye but maybe poorly made? One of the rings I got was missing a couple jewels. Three of the rings I got were great! Maybe 2 or 3 of the other ones I never wear because of the quality. Some of them are a tad uncomfortable too and hurt the fingers next to the one with the ring.

So when I received it, it was super short and not the look I was hoping to get. Also, the fact that I \u201cwon\u201d a gift card yet the gift card doesn\u2019t work on shipping and then I can\u2019t use the whole amount won because there\u2019s a 3 piece limit, not fair. Then icing on the cake. When placing an order it showed a $0 shipping charge but when I entered a discount code, boom, shipping is now $30. I called customer service to inquire and they said if your in a certain area shipping is $0 (which is why it showed $0) but because I was getting a discount I need to pay an out of country shipping fee. CRAZY! This is not how you attract a fan base when gift cards in USA can be used like a credit card. Shipping fees are generally part of the \u201cfee\u201d that can be paid with a gift card. It\u2019s just a shady way to make more $ off customers!

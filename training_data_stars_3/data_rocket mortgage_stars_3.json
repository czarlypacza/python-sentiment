Because of this we had to extend the first payment date for the loan so we would personally have enough money to pay those credit cards off ourselves which cost us extra in interest payments added into the loan. Lastly we had to have an in person notary for the closing because the online closing couldn\u2019t recognize us based on our answers to their questions based on prior city\u2019s that we were not affiliated with and questions about different automobiles that were also incorrect. Not sure where they get their information from, but it might not actually apply to you. So we were unable to do everything online which pushed our closing date back another 5 days.

I am recently divorced so I was looking to defer payments for a couple of months to avoid possible bankruptcy.  When I called I got an agent who explained that I could do that or I could roll over all my cards onto my house payment.  He then said that with the equity I have in my house that I could take out $5000 of that and it would make my payment an even $900.  I asked him multiple times if it would be exactly $900, no hidden or surprise fees.  I was assured that there would not be.  I explained that I am a single mother and recently divorced and that I could not afford much more than that.  I am currently working 2 jobs.  In the process of all of this, I am contacted by at least 3 different people everyday, but phone calls and texts.  Some text to ask if I would consider using Rocket to refinance. He said I could get a better rate than what I was quoted.   I called that one back and asked how that was possible since I was already going thru Rocket and had my current mortgage thru Rocket.  It was very confusing.  I would then get texts, back to back, from different agents.  When I would call them back I would have to explain the whole process to each of them.  I have very limited time with working 16hrs a day 6 days a week.  When they finally came back with the final cost, it was $933.  I was very confused.  When I called him he explained about fees and all that.  I was angry because I was promised it would not be over $900.  At this time I was still getting the $5000.  When I spoke with the closing title company I was told I was getting back only $280.  So I called again and he now said my debt ratio was more than he realized.  The agent made me feel as if I was stupid.  I talked to another agent at one point and I told her that I felt I was being taken advantage of because I was a single woman.  I truly felt that I was tricked.  I used the title company that Rocket picked out.  They told me I was not getting any money back at all and that I owed them $280.  After I paid them they  then realized that they owed me the $280.  I was told by the agent that this process of refinance would be quick and easy.  It has been anything but.  He made it seem like within the week it would be over.  It has been over a month or more.  It was just closed.  I was told everything would be online and yet I had to leave work to go to the title company.  The title company called Rocket and explained that a couple of the credit cards that were rolling over into the house payment had been paid off.  I was told not to stop paying on them so since the process has taken so long a couple were paid off.  The title company tried to explain that to Rocket and the agent was not concerned. I had even sent in recent statements and they did not want to see them.  They paid off my cards so now I have a credit to those cards.  That money would have been more useful elsewhere.The app to set up my payments and autopay is not allowing me to set up the correct date.  I had thought that my old autopay would have stopped on its own since the loan was paid off.  Yet my payment was taken out last week. I tried to set up the new loan and dates, but it won't let me go into May, which is when my first payment is due.  It has been a hassle.  I do not have time to keep calling and having to explain everything.  I literally have about 30 minutes between jobs.  I was upset that they are not including my second job as income.  My debt ratio would be better then.  I have not been at the job for 2 years yet.  I work in a school so every summer I would get a summer job.  So now they won't consider any jobs as a second income because I have not been at any for 2 years.  I started almost full time at a restaurant in Aug when my marriage broke up.  I also have a consolidation loan with my ex.  Because of that it has made the debt ratio not great.  The whole loan is being considered my debt even tho the divorce decree states that we are both required to pay half.  So  that it why I am not able to get the 5000 from the equity.  My furnance went out and I had been counting on that money to get a new one.  I would have never refinanced just to refinance.  He explained that I would get 5000 dollars to help get the furnance and have a cushion since my house payment is going up.  Now I am not getting it.  I feel I was tricked and every single person had a different idea or explaination.  I am very unhappy and when I am in a better position I am very seriously considering doing another refinance with another company.  I felt very stupid, talked down to, tricked, and mislead.

I was given a phone to contact for an appeal of the appraisal. Which I did and I must rate Jon Ager a 5 star as he got the issue resolved in 24 hrs. I spoke with him on Friday evening, he called me on SATURDAY evening with an answer and a resolution.I questioned the competency of the approval department for the following reasons: 20 acres of land is equivalent to approximately FIVE football fields; I owned a TOWNHOUSE.  I have never heard or seen a townhouse with 20 acres of land. My townhouse is attached on 1 side; They had pics of my home, front and back which clearly showed that I had minimal land space around my townhouse. I have my mortgage with them, THAT was approved. The loan was for the same property. Common sense would have alerted a Red Flag that there was an error....and maybe, just maybe they would review my records....since it WAS  the same company and WAS the same property that was mortgaged and applicable to the loan request. The appraiser documented incorrectly or not as he should. He documented the size of my COMMUNITY. Again thank you Jon Ager for realizing that it made no sense and followed up.The loan was eventually approved shortly after but I did have 2nd thoughts after that experience.

I was unaware that they would be doing that. I asked if I could just pay those amounts off separately but I was told no. I went ahead and rolled with it. The debt amounts, other than one, were incorrect but I\u2019m told I\u2019ll get refunded. I am still waiting on that. The only overpaid amount I have received was from my title company.

(We had to pay over $5K in interest payments that was just money thrown away!)  After our house appraised at $100,000 more than we were getting out, someone should have been able to relax some procedures - knowing you could always get your money back.  I was glad to get loan but because of DELAYS, DELAYS, and 3-day waiting periods, interest was higher than what we started with and the STRESS and DELAYS made the 'ending' anticlimatical for me.

That was where the problems started.  We were not informed about how or when we would receive the funds for the cash out, and the payoffs for the various loans and credit cards.  It took a number of calls to several different individuals (our original loan adviser ghosted us after the closing and failed to answer, return calls and/or texts.)  We were able to determine that the vehicle loan and former mortgage were paid off quickly by the new lender, and the cash out amount appeared in our requested account, however we did not know how the other creditors were to be paid.  After a week of trying to find that out, we finally received individual checks for all the remaining creditors.  Since the checks were made out to the creditors, I had to research each one to find a proper place to send them and who should receive them.  Some of the checks showed they were My husband's account, and he was not on the account, causing more confusion.  It took three full days of hunting down addresses and phone numbers for 9 different creditors.  In addition, I was advised by Rocket Mortgage to send using a tracking number.  I wanted to get them out as quickly as possible to avoid additional interest charges, and since it was Christmas season I fought the lines at UPS and USPS (UPS doesn't ship to P.O. numbers and some of the addresses I eventually got for several of the creditors were P. O. Boxes).  It cost me nearly $300.00 for all of the shipping charges.  Then the follow up started.  Only a couple of the creditors received and posted the payments in a couple of days after receipt.  As of 16 days post closing, two of them have still not posted the payments, causing additional interest to be added, and at least two more awkward days of hunting down someone to speak with me about it.  All of this could have EASILY been avoided if the payments for creditors had been made available to me to post electronically immediately after being received, since that is how they were all being paid.  Several of them don't even allow (they are not set up for) for paper checks as payment.  Or, if we are not \"trusted\" to make the payments ourselves, then AmRock could make the payments directly themselves.  Either way would save nearly a full week of excruciating research and dispersal and substantial additional cost for mailing and tracking, in addition to the unnecessary additional interest charges accrued by the additional time for the payments to be posted.    I feel I should be reimbursed at least for the cost of postage and interest.

On November 28 a representative that Rocket Mortgage sent to my house came in for the closing. He had everything highlighted for signature and this happens very fast.After, everything was signed he stated that the funds would be deposited within 48 hours.  I checked everyday the Rocket Mortgage app because we were told by Darr that if anything needed to be done it would be in the app.   Days went by and no deposit was made. On December 7, I received a phone call by Christopher Betancourt and he told me that an error was made in the calculation of the loan and that is why I had not received the money.  So basically, the loan was not closed unless I signed the new document. At that time I asked if my due date would be change because of the error and he told me to contact Rocket Mortgage.  I called Rocket Mortgage and was transferred a couple of time after inquiring about the due date. Finally, I was transfer to customer relations or client relations and spoke to a women who I cannot remember her name.  It was obvious that she may had been in charged because of her demeanor on the phone.  I explained to her what had happened and she said that despite the issue my first payment was going to be due on January 1, 2024. I told her that that was 24 days away and that I have not received the money.  She said, again 1 January my payment was due.  I said, I have not received the money lady, so why would I make a payment on money that I have not received. She said, that during my 28 November closing I signed a document that stated so and no one could change that.I told her that I was told that about the 45 days after payment was received. She said that I didn\u2019t have a payment in December and I said, \u201coff course not, you haven\u2019t pay me yet.\u201d She said, you got a free month December because you didn\u2019t pay your previous loan.  I said, listen lady check your facts because my house payment is paid through March 2024. This has nothing to do with you not wanting to honor the 45 days and by this time her blabbing was annoying.

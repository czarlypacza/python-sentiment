I have worked with them for over 2 years trying to get my residency and still have nothing.I paid them 5000 euros to help my wife and I with residency in portugal.

I told them that there is not enough time now and why did they tell me on whatsapp all i need is my passport.They were unapologetic and rude and  told me its my responsibility to know what paperwork i need not theres, so i must stop blaming them.

After more than 6 months of waiting i reached out to them on whatsapp and asked what the impact would be of me hiring a second lawyer  to help me get an appointment would be, they did not respond. I asked multiple times and got no response. I have screenshots to prove this. So i went ahead and hired a second law firm to get me an appointment. The new law firm got me an appointment within one week ( e residency claimed they were trying for more than 6 months) When i informed them that i got an appomtment at the SEF and can they please assist me, they told me that they are unable to help me. I asked for a reason and they would not provide it to me. I asked to meet with them on zoom and they refuse. I asked my proof of address that i paid them for and they said its expired.

The company is aware of the problem but has not been able to resolve it for some 5 months now. For the past 4 months my messages have been ignored (no response whatsoever to my emails) and there is no other way I can get in touch with anyone to find out about the status of my problem and how and by when it is going to be resolved. It makes me sad to give a bad review to a company that has predominantly excellent reviews. If the company responds to my messages and resolves the problem, I may revise this review.I received my NIF within a few days after applying. I also received the respective password some weeks later. My last name is misspelled on that NIF (there is a letter missing, most people wouldn\u2019t realize it) so I asked for the spelling to be corrected. That\u2019s where the problems began. Instead of correcting the spelling of my last name, I was assigned another NIF (by another office and with a new fiscal representative), this time with the correct spelling of my name. But now I have two NIF\u2019s and cannot be sure which one I should use, the one with the misspelled last name which I already used to open a bank account (and for which I received a password) or the one with the correct spelling for which I never received a password (it\u2019s been 5 months so far). Additionally, since someone can have only one NIF, one of the two needs be cancelled, which has not happened yet.The problem with e-residence seems to be that the company really has no influence over the fiscal authorities. If there is a problem, they cannot solve it. They do not have insider access, a fixer, or some special way to make things happen. They must wait like everybody else for their requests to get acted upon. All of this would not be so bad if they communicated effectively (or in my case if they communicated at all) with the client. Even before they broke up contact, the communications were very short, bordering on rude, showing no empathy with the client.My expectation is that the company apologizes for the fact that they did not respond to my messages, that they listen to my preferred solution, that we agree on how to resolve this and by when, and that I receive regular updates along the way, and that they answer promptly any questions that may come up until the problem is being resolved.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "NIF was not accepted by the bank\u2026", "text": "NIF was not accepted by the bank because it was partly handwritten and so provisionally.The bank didn\u2019t accept.I hope you sent the official document to my home adres.Anyway : it means that I have to come back to Portugal to make this things in order.So: not happy with your (expensive) service.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Waiting for NIF access for +2 months", "text": "I've been waiting for the password to access AT for +2 months.

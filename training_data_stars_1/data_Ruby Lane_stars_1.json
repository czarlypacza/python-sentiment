I wore it a couple of times (literally once or twice) and then noticed the back had come off unbeknownst to me. I contacted the seller and described the issue and got what appeared to be a template response. I took the watch first to a local jeweler, then to a watch and clock specialist, who told me the watch could only be repaired by replacing the backing with a part of the same model. I reached back out to the shop for the model number but never received an acknowledgement or reply despite repeated attempts to contact them.I reached out to Customer Support who did nothing but what I had already tried, which was to send more emails to an unresponsive seller. An item is NOT in EXCELLENT condition if it cannot withstand even minimal wear. Neither the seller nor Ruby Lane was willing to stand behind the merchandise. I now have a watch that was clearly sold to me in POOR condition, that I can't wear, that I can't recoup my money for, or even attempt to fix since the seller can't be bothered to respond with a model number so I can try to find the needed part.

I did not look at her when she arrived, waiting for the holidays to open it.  I didn't give it a thought that she would be anything more than perfect. However, she was advertised as a 22\" doll and no mention of any flaws. But she was only 19inches and has a flaw underneath her eyebrow and several spots on her cheek all of which were not visible. After looking at the doll, I contactedKathy explaining the situation. On Jan 3, 2020, she emailed me with her offering to repay all shipping to us and return shipping of the doll and the offer to give a 10% discount on my next purchase. After several she made another offer to take $200 off of the purchase price.  I didn't want a Jumeau doll with flaws nor one that was 19\"tall.  I had looked at her offer of selecting another doll with a 10% discount among her 500 dolls. Thereafter there were several emails   and I have  copies of after Jan 3,2020.  These changed her offerings from now to the $200 refund, now to a 10% discount of any doll similar in price to the original doll.  I found another doll,which is  referenced above referring to her offer of Jan 3. but I received received no reply other than send the doll back and you will get a refund.  Because I fell in love in love with the new doll, I accepted her offer of $4,414. I feel that she was acting as a professional person, offering one thing on Jan. 3 2020, and not honoring that proposition, constantly changing her position, and not backing up her statement.  I feel that this is not professional. and am requesting 10% off the price of the new doll which is $414.00. In addition, she offered to repay return shipping which was $42 I have a copy of that also.  I am more than disgusted with her professionalism and manner in which she responds to issues but now the doll I original bought is back on ebay with the exact description of 22\"Jumeau with no mention of flaws. Some buyer is going to open the box and see a 19\" doll with flaws  instead of the one described with Kathy Libraty.  I understand NOW what her return policy is and unfortunately did not read it, only thinking that my husband will \"hide it for Christmas\".  Maybe that is childish but I never thought I needed to open the box to verify its description.

Huge new fees have been imposed on buyers and sellers and if you are a US citizen, you get landed with state tax too, lovely jubbly!!The bit i like best is what they charge to Buyers - it is called a 2.9% 'Buyer's service charge'. Devious trading, they should call this 'Rubylane Service Charge' because this money goes to Rubylane. They are making believe that the seller is imposing this charge, but Rubylane are imposing this charge. They must think that we were all born yesterday.All done sneekily, 'purchase orders' for buyers are super escalated with state tax and Rubylane commission, hoping that they will not notice and just pay quietly. Many do and i feel sorry for them.A commission of 3.75% falls due for sellers shortly on the 1st January 2020. More lovely jubbly dosh for Rubylane. There excuse for the new high commission rates is that ''We have to pay the State Tax to the US Government and this is labour intensive''. Oh yes, pull the other one, it's got bells on!!Another funny feature is that Sellers on the site have NOW become ''collectors'', collecting the  commission and tax charges which they surrender at the end of the month to Rubylane.

Either that or quit the site.Many sellers on the site appear to being dealing away from Rubylane to avoid the charges, just using the site as a shopping window and then going for the kill behind the back door.

The worst part?

Wayfair! What happens then?  Is the seller refunded the sales tax?  NO, it goes into RL's pocket, which is probably illegal.Update: Ah, a response, delivered with first a non-sequitur, then the classic RL opacity and condescension.Not sure why flexibility is invoked since there isn\u2019t any at RL, it\u2019s irrelevant, so moving on: RL has not been transparent about the additional fees nor the issue of \u201cmarketplace facilitators\u201d.

There was a 30% off sale. The item was $22 so the sale price should have been $15.40, but it was $16. I asked the seller & RL if they round up the prices and both said yes. I purchased salt & pepper shakers from a seller that misrepresented the condition of one of them, it had defects along the bottom. I contacted him about this and he played it off as though he did nothing wrong. Long story short, it was a bad buying experience. When I left my review of the seller, his remarks made me seem as though I was the shady one, that I complained about the price & he did nothing wrong. When I replied again thru Trustpilot, my review had been removed completely. According to RL, they contact Trustpilot on behalf of the seller if they feel the review isn't fair and then it's up to Trustpilot to decide if it should be removed (per Simon on live chat at RL). So the sellers/RL/TP make sure there aren't any negative reviews. The response from Ruby Lane below confirms the sellers have the ability to have negative reviews removed.

I fully expected the shop owner to say, \"Send it back and I'll get it fixed or perhaps you would like a refund, etc.\"  But no, she said she would let me return it but keep in mind the time period for returning it had long expired.  I visited a nearby jeweler who said that, of course, with the C clasp being so far above the pin, it would flop over.  I asked could he fix it.  He said no, but maybe I could wear it on a very thick fabric, maybe 1/2\" thick.  I told this to Lisa and she replied that I was wearing the pin on the wrong fabric. I don't even own a dress, blouse or coat with fabric that thick.  Absurd suggestion.  I live in the South, not in Alaska. I told her I would return it but then decided it was not worth $20.00 (shipping from L. Kramer and then back to L. Kramer) so I waited until my husband again would drive me to a jeweler.

Kramer woman had 5 stars so didn't look through every review until after I was disappointed.  L. Kramer got what she wanted.

Their written purchase policies are different then what they tell you personally; that is when you can actually talk to a live person. They want everything done via email and routinely contradict themselves in an effort to keep your money instead of canceling an order for return. They strong arm and threaten by setting payment deadlines that are un-reasonable, like telling you on a Friday that if they do not receive the payment the following Monday, you forfeit the sale and the deposit. They do this especially on lay-a-way or payment plans. They accuse the purchaser of not mailing in the payments in time which allows them to cancel the order, keep the money AND the item. Then they admit to not checking their mail for several days or having it forwarded to another area business when they are not around. The merchandise is also not what they advertise it. The do not know their products and are over priced.I blame Ruby Lane because they do not vet their vendors and do not offer any assistance in resolving any disputes with their vendors. Their attitude is \"buyer beware\" and solve the problem on your own. If you can't trust Ruby Lane then you can't trust their vendors. I will not deal with Ruby Lane ever again.To respond Maddy, you say \"Ruby Lane takes note of any dissatisfactory transactions between a buyer and a shop owner and if there is a recurring issue, we will close down the shop.\" I find it sad that you only take note and then only action against your vendors over recurring issues. Seems Ruby Lane only cares about any egregious offenses to customers until it becomes systemic and problematic with no regard to the customer who has a singular but serious problem that needs intervention in resolving an issue. Especially with a vendor like Beacon Hill who make up their own rules once they get your money and are holding your purchase hostage.In fact, when a call was placed to Ruby Lane Customer Service and to the office of Tom Johnson, Founder, President and CEO about our problems, we were told on both accounts that it wasn't Ruby Lane's policy to intervene in customer-buyer disputes.Maddie, you can very easily search reviews on line for Beacon Hill Jewelers and find many less than positive complaints. It is something I should have down before dealing with them but given what was thought to be the reputable name of Ruby Lane, it was assumed that the quality and integrity of your vendors was vetted.You say to feel free to contact your customer support team and they will be happy to assist.

It was astounding, absurd, atrocious--meat for Stephen King. I found an antique doll in the HoneyandShar shop on the Ruby Lane site. Due to its skimpy description, I emailed for more detail. I received an uninformative two-word response. Knowing from this I should vamoose and  look elsewhere for a doll, I chose to pursue this one because I was buying it for a terminally ill friend who had seen it online and admired it. So I emailed again with several very specific questions about its condition, including the valuation of the doll since it was 3 times more expensive than others I had seen. The answer: the doll is 26\" and the largest made in this model and the price reflects size and rarity. Huh? The doll was listed by the seller as 22\".  No, says seller. It's 26\"--she is looking at it and just measured it. Now I ask if fingers are missing which I thought I detected in the photo. Response: no fingers missing. I send proof. Seller says, Yes, finger is missing. \r  EEEK. Now I am looking elsewhere and find a similar doll on Ebay. Then I notice it's the same seller. By now I am desperate to make this work out for my friend, and have a sort of morbid curiosity about these sellers. So I enquire as to how this doll compares to the other. Answer: \"It's just another doll.\" Scout's honor. That's the direct quote. OK. Now my Sherlock Holmes and Sigmund Freud multiple personalities enter the quest. Seller sends me photos of dolls together, again stating their sizes as 26\" and 22\". Yep, the original doll is much larger, more lifelike I think. And this is the one my friend loves. So I do the unthinkable. I make an offer for the Ruby Lane 26\u201d doll. (All this seller's listings  invite offers.) Doll is priced at $1200; Seller won't budge beyond $1050, reminding me of its rare 26\" size. I do the unpardonable. I buy it. Welllll, I try to buy it. Turns out the seller doesn't know how to invoice through the Ruby Lane site. Insists I simply send her the payment directly. Uh, no. I don't think so. I explain several times I want a Ruby Lane sanctioned sale (and the safety of its return policy!) After a total of 12 emails in which I explain to the seller how to invoice her sale, she can't do it. I contact Ruby Lane. RL says no prob. Send it to her. It was listed on our site. You are golden. Okeydokey but don't you guys think it's a bit odd for one of your experienced sellers? And by the way, the doll is still incorrectly listed as 22\" on your site. Wellllllll ya know, says RL, a different team would handle that.....  \r I PayPal the money. A day later no acknowledgement or receipt, no PO or tracking number on my RL account. I send the 33rd email (I actually counted them wanting to track my spiral into insanity). Oh yeah. She got it. Packing this big beautiful girl now! I confirm head will be removed and stuffed to protect eye rocker. Nope. No need, 30 years in dolls.......  By now my migraine prescription is running low so I don't argue.   \rAND NOW. The finale you readers believe I so deserve for my stupidity.  The doll arrives. I open it. I oh so carefully unwrap it with trembling fingers to find a 22\u201d Ruby Lane DOLL. \rA 22\" doll with a split arm and wrist and a 1\" square chink of loose composition in the wrapping. (One of my emails asked if the composition issues were surface or deeper split and cracks. ) A 22\" doll with multiple fractures AND one eye frozen at half mast with the upper half chipped paint. How's that 30 years of expert packing working out......?  Back to the email. All the lurid details. Many photos. Doll with measuring tape. Seller's leisurely  response: \"I'm sorry you're not pleased. You can return her and I will refund you if she's in the same condition I sent her.\" No explanation. No apology. No reference to blatant misrepresentation. NADDA Nada. And does anyone see another snake head poking up through the \"same condition\" clause? She will cover the return shipping (IF the doll is as sublime as it was when it left her) because that's just the kinda gal she is. I now have a 3 day return window. I contact Ruby Lane to be sure my tees are crossed. Alphabet soup. Customer service guy Mark quotes me the RL scriptures, tells me it's been turned over to another team member HIKE (who turns out NOT to be Peyton Manning), he Mark can't help me cuz the ball is not in play yet, and this is another golden nugget of a quote: \"Oh my, I can't find the sale on your account!\" Several minutes ensue in which I explain to Mark exactly where and how he can find that information as I am staring at it as we speak. No can do. Mark is offended and rude when I gently ask if I might speak with a supervisor ( preferably someone who can access their accounts.) Now another CS member suits up and he verbally spanks me for not memorizing the RL scriptures, reminds me it is Friday afternoon and I'm not the only one with needs. He clearly wants to begin his TGIF and assures me yet another team player will contact me. I remind him I am calling because I want to abide by the rules but need to speak with someone about what happens when their illustrious seller does NOT refund. I'm told it's buyer beware. Contact Paypal. OK but exactly HOW should RL customers be responsible for detecting misrepresentations of sales items, and doctored photos in the listings? No answer except we'll look into it. That was a week ago. As of now, the listing has not been corrected, and Sonny and Char are  still \"selling\" and singing \"It Ain't Me, Babe....\"\r Finally the seller agrees to pay for return shipping given the circumstances. After I carefully repack the doll and ship it, I email the seller the tracking number and a reminder of our agreement that she will refund the return shipping. Response: \"What makes you think I would pay for return shipping?\" Now I KNOW I'm being taped for \"What Would YOU Do...\" I forward her e-mail of the previous day, and she remembers. The doll has now been refunded, as have shipping costs. I suspect RL's \"WHASSUP? note may have had something to do with that.

A colorized print in other words.   Because of 3 day deadline I was told  no recourse.

The five stone channel set princess diamond band I purchased was stated to contain 1.16 carat weight in diamonds and a total gram weight of 5.2.The ring arrived promptly and I was excited to see it after viewing the lovely pictures online as well as the posted appraisal. First I took out the appraisal which turned out to only be a fuzzy hardly readable photo copy with the bottom seal cut off.  Then I opened the box to see a pretty ring but seriously questioned the carat weight of the center stone. Then I removed the ring from the box and it didn't appear to have the heavy gram weight stated in the description. This was a Saturday and a local family owned jewelry store I deal with was open so I took the ring down there just to see if my concerns were valad. The jeweler tested the diamonds as real and proceeded to measure the stones with a jewelers caliper. That's were the inconsistencies between the appraisal and the actual ring started. \rItem # 14KSPB003\rWas said to contain a center princess diamond .43 carat weight\rJeweler measured  stone at .31ct.\rPrincess diamonds on either side were stated to be .21 on one side and .22 on the other.\rJeweler measured stones as .18 each\rPrincess diamonds on outside were stated to be .14 and .16.\rJeweler measured stones as .13 each.\rThis may not seem like much of a difference but on the center stone alone, the focal point of the ring that's a 12 point difference.  That's taking the stone from almost a half carat (50 pts.) down to a third carat (30 pts.)\rThat makes this certified appraised 1.16 carat diamond ring was actually only a .93 carat ring. The ring was .33 cts. less than claimed to be. That's over a third carat difference! In the world of appraised jewelery that's huge.The jeweler also weighed the ring at 4.43 grams. The description of the ring stated heavy 5.2 grams.\rBottom line there is no way that appraisal went with that ring.\rI brought my concerns to the vendors attention and she proceeded to get very defensive and called me nasty and arrogant and said she never should have sold it to me and that I had gotton a good deal and I knew it.\rThe ring may have been a good price , but it was not what it was stated to be.\rThat poor excuse for an appraisal wasn't worth the paper it was copied on!\rBesides being totally inaccurate it would never have been accepted as legitimate for  insurance purposes.\rThough some may not care about the  appraisal for their insurance company a certified appraisal is important when your buying online. It assures you your getting what you pay for.\rJust a word to the wise.\rBy the way I was on Ruby Lane today and this vendor has relisted the ring with the same original inaccurate information and inaccurate appraisal! Even though she was informed of all these inconsistencies, claiming to not know in one breath and in another email claiming to know jewelry! \rBEWARE!\rNo more business with Oddities and Antiquities!", "rating": 1}, {"title": "outrageous shipping costs", "text": "I am very disappointed that a seller requires a shipping cost of $35 for a $9 item!

I have purchased from Ruby Lane before many times and I overlook back pictures, erroneous descriptions, no condition report, excessive shipping costs just to buy an items that looks good to me and know no problem return/refund Ruby Lane policy. But this time it was just totally unacceptable experience, unreasonable and rude conduct. I purchase 2 items from Robert Steffen from  The Steffen Collection.  I check the money order payment option. I email to Robert Steffen with 2 questions: where to send my payment and what is it Standard USPS shipping. I didn't get any reply so I call him. He said he can't hear me and can't understand what I'm saying. I told him that I have sent email with questions. He said he is going to look!? (he can hear me and can understand me) . He said he will email payment address. I ask what is Standard USPS shipping and he said its land shipping and may takes 2-3 weeks!? One of the item is crystal bowl and its weight 10 1/4 pounds. I told him that I would like to ship this item by 2-days Priority Mail. He said its very expensive. I just look at USPS shipping calculator and it was $43. I told him that and said I have no problem to pay this costs. He said no its much more then this and this is to complicated and email this request to him. I email this request to him and ask to re-issue the purchase order and include all details and I will send my payment. This is what stated in Ruby Lane email to me \"The shop owner, not Ruby Lane, will contact you shortly to confirm this Order, explain any Shipping/Handling, Insurance or Sales Tax, and to make payment arrangements.\" After that he send me $95 total for shipment and no details. I email him and ask for details. I went to look for some details and when I click on links to items I find that both orders are canceled and items are relisted and no any notice to me.

Though we were initially very pleased with the service, subsequent developments necessitate contacting you.It turns out that two insurance policies were issued, rather than one. I was unaware of this until I checked my VISA credit card account regarding the end of our billing cycle. I then noted your company had submitted to our credit card two charges, each in the amount of $1514.60. We called your company on 9/19/23. The agent cancelled policy TCLX284024469, issuing a credit to our VISA account. However, the email regarding this cancellation stated it would take 3-8 business for the refund to post to our account.The result is that I have had to now pay 2 charges, each in the amount of $1514.60 to my credit card company since the billing cycle has ended. I now have to wait for my refund that will appear on my next credit card statement.Needless to say, these developments have made me rather unhappy with the service provided.Sincerely, SJW",

One AARDY agent sold me two individual policies one for my husband and one for myself when I wanted a joint policy. I agreed to keep it because they said it was the same. But when I tried to increase the insurance amount of the policies there was a problem. The agent that day told me it is cheaper if I was insuring a couple then buying 2 separate policies so I was looking at a higher cost.  I was then advised to buy another joint policy which was less expensive and stack the policies. At this point I had 3 policies for the same trip. I eventually called Trawick rather than work through AARDY and thankfully they straightened this mess out. You can't stack policies. Other problems. The agents at AARDY are not all well trained leading to confusion. You might want to call travel insurance companies directly.",

Despite confirming receipt of these documents, Driveway repeatedly requested my insurance card over the following weeks. When I reached out for updates, they assured me my paperwork was in progress, only to later reveal that they hadn't submitted it to the DMV until October 17\u2014**two full weeks** after I sent everything required on time. This delay has left me with temporary plates valid only until October 31.As that expiration date approaches, I\u2019m left in a terrible position, unable to legally drive the car I\u2019m paying for.

The pictures, which should have been provided prior to the $500 payment, revealed cosmetic issues, including scratches, nicks, and a small indent from a baby seat.* September 12, 2024: I received the vehicle but immediately noticed that two roof rails were missing.

They are very professional, helpful and quick.  The customer service call center and chat operators are very good at their jobs and try to help.  The problem is with the delivery process.  I purchased a 2019 Lexus UX from Driveway on 9/21/24.  I loved the car, based on how it appeared on the website. From my car searches online, I hadn't seen another one like it.  You know how when shopping and you finally see the perfect item and get the feeling of \"That is it, That's the one!\"  I had that feeling and  therefore decided it was worth paying the more expensive delivery cost to bring it from California to North Carolina.  The interior is unique and very nice. However, I have yet to see it in person, let alone drive it, because it hasn't been delivered as of noon on Monday, 10/7/24.  When it was finally put on the truck on 9/29/24, Clara in shipping updated me about this status via text.  I got excited that my car was en route.  I checked in with Clara mid week and was told that it was on time for delivery to the distribution center on Friday, 10/4 and I would be updated once it was delivered. I am in eastern NC and the western part of the state was devastated by hurricane flooding.  I became concerned that the delivery drivers wouldn't be able to get through because large sections of I-40 are impassable.  Partially concerned for their safety and a potential delay, I checked in with Clara and informed her about the roads and asked her to please check on the drivers.  She replied \"Got It\" and kept insisting via text in what seemed like a robotic tone, that the vehicle is on time for delivery to the distribution center on 10/4.  It felt like my text questions were bothering her and I do not like to do that.  However, by 5:00 pm on 10/4 when I hadn't been updated the car was delivered to the distribution center, I texted Clara again and asked for an update and asked if they work late into the evenings.  I got her same robotic reply, delivery is confirmed on 10/4.  She then immediately texted me again and added the distribution center is neither open late nor open on the weekends.  It was a big let down because I was so looking forward to showing off my new wheels over the weekend. I asked her what happened to being on time for delivery to the distribution center on 10/4?  To that, she said she would have the supervisor contact me leaving me to wonder if there was an accident or some other issue that requires a supervisor to let me know about.  I have never heard from a supervisor.  I started the purchase process on 9/21.  Today is 10/7 and as far as I know, the vehicle could be on the moon.  I have no idea when it will get to the distribution center.  I have no way to get around as my other car was sold. I keep mentioning distribution center in my review because it is important to note that if you are expecting to get your car the day it arrives at the distribution center, you will not.  Clara fails to inform you that it has to go through a process when it gets there so only God knows when the actual delivery date to me is.  I sure have no idea when I am getting my car.  In the meantime, I have financed the car and the first payment will be due on 11/9/24.  I am going to be paying for a whole month for a car that I do not have. I am seriously considering canceling this purchase because I have been stuck at home with no car to drive since I started the purchase process on 9/21.  I cannot get to work and at some point, I am going to lose my job and then won't be able to pay for the car.  I have been lucky enough to work from home but do not want to keep pushing that.However, my down payment funds are now tied up in the Lexus and if I cancel, I would have to wait an additional unknown time period to get the money returned to buy another vehicle.  It is quite a conundrum and a mess.  Just know that if you need a car, do not consider an online purchase where the car is being delivered to you from out of state.  I know I naively made that decision; foolishly trusting that it would not take so long get from California to North Carolina.  I wouldn't be so upset if I was honestly communicated with about this issue/process.  But, I have been continuously told the car was on time for delivery to the distribution center on 10/4.  Even in the age of cellphones, no one actually checks to see if that is true. Obviously it was not delivered to the distribution center and I haven't yet been informed of that nor have I been told when I would actually have a car. I am losing money each day I am not able to use the car.  I am so disappointed. Driveway has to get a better handle on their shipping process.  Once they do, they will have a good system.

I sent all this to the Driveway like they asked and they didn't believe that tires were cupping and the rotors were in need of replacement or just about everything the 2 shops I took it to found. I took it to America's tire and they also found the tires to be cupping and in need of replacement.

We found the car we wanted and were paying in full- we called in and placed our order through their instructions and were happy but we were na\u00efve. We again had informed them from the beginning that we were paying the full balance of the car at once and all they needed to do was call to collect payment and send the documents over for signing. This process alone took about 2 weeks. Our sales agent Orlando never answered our calls when we tried we had to call the general number and ask for him by name to get through. We found out he mistakenly submitted the documents to the wrong states purchasing department so adding about a week to our total time. Of course he never told us this, just ignored our calls and I had to find out through someone else. Next when the documents were being \u201covernighted\u201d they really arrived about a week later saying UPS never sent them out. I have worked with shipping for years and know that isn\u2019t how UPS operates. Again, overnighted and took 3 days to arrive. We signed immediately and sent it over thankfully. Our car was sent to Orlando, FL. We had called over 20 times looking for any update during the total process of the purchase and I had specified I was picking the vehicle up in person in Orlando yet no one apparently noted this to the dealership. We finally got it, they didn\u2019t check our IDs or our insurance which is terrifying to think about. We drive down the road only to realize we had less than 15 miles, they never gave us a temporary tag or a second key. So we drive back and have been waiting here for now 2 1/2 hours for SOMEONE to email a temporary tag to us so we can go home. This may be the most inconvenient process of anything i have ever experienced. I will never buy another vehicle from this platform again.

This was a 2022 GMC Sierra SLT with the 3.0L diesel engine.  It only had 29k miles on it.  The carfax was clean.  This truck came from a dealership in WV.  The name of the dealership is Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram Fiat of Morgantown WV.  The belly pan was missing under the truck which tells me that the dealer looked at the oil leak and did nothing about it.  I called Driveway the day after the truck arrived and requested to return the truck for a refund.  They asked me if I wanted to take it to a dealer for an estimate to repair it.  This truck is under factory warranty, but I did not buy a broken truck and I did not want to deal with having it repaired.  It took them 2 weeks to pickup the truck.  I was able to track the truck with the BOL number that the driver gave me.  It went back to the same dealer in WV and 1 day later it was listed for sale again on Driveway.com.  It is currently still listed for sale.  They did not have time to fix the oil leaks and the touchscreen.  They are going to sell it \"BROKEN\" again and someone else is going to have to go through the same thing that I just went through.  It took 2 more weeks to get my money back and they did not refund my shipping cost of $1200 even though they were 100% at fault for selling me a broken vehicle that they knew was broken.

I started the order in November 2023 it is now the end of December 2023 that the vehicle was just delivered. It took weeks to receive condition photos of the vehicle and required several follow ups and self advocating. I advised driveway of a delivery date I would be available. Then received a random call from a third party carrier that the car was being delivered on a day I was not available. I had to redo my entire schedule to take the delivery. Once the vehicle arrived it was horrific. Driveway promised me they detail their vehicles ahead of delivery. The vehicle was not detailed at all, absolutely filthy inside and a horrific smell that made me nauseous. The vehicle was also delivered with the entire trunk floor missing, exposed wires and hardware. Also the vehicle had severe issues, an extremely loud noise that sounded like an airplane from the back of the car among other mechanical issues and this was supposedly a throughly inspected and certified vehicle by their dealership. Once the 7 day trial started with all the issues from day one the vehicle ended up sitting at a local service center with all the issues it was delivered with and currently still dealing with all the issues. This has taken so many days and hours out of my life to deal with.

She was able to get me my temp tags via email same day, she agreed in writing that I would receive my hard plates in a timely manner, and she was able to get me two more days to test drive the car. In all, I didn't have the 7 days as advertised, but it did give me enought time to drive the car and get a pre purchase inspection completed. The car is in great shape. It just needs an alignment, breaks and roders. I also found out that the car didn't have a paint defect. It has paint protectors in certain areas that have to be peeled off. Dirt had accumulated underneath them in areas and gave the appearance of rust. All in all this is the best car that I've purchased so far.

This crucial documentation, essential for legal operation of the vehicle, remains elusive despite my repeated efforts to resolve the issue.Calling Driveway's customer service has been an exercise in futility. I have dialed their number twenty-five times, each call met with promises of resolution that never materialize. The lack of competence and accountability from their representatives is staggering. It is simply unacceptable to leave a paying customer in limbo for this long, especially after such a substantial purchase.What adds insult to injury is the complete absence of communication or empathy from Driveway's side. Not once has anyone from their team reached out to apologize for the inconvenience caused or to offer any form of compensation for the countless hours I have wasted trying to rectify their mistake. It is astonishing to me that a company could treat a customer who spent $25,000 in this manner.To say I am disappointed would be an understatement. The level of disregard and neglect I have experienced throughout this ordeal is unprecedented in my consumer history.

THANKS ", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Absolute disaster", "text": "Absolute disaster. Do not use Driveway.comUpdate after car secured:I decided now that I have the car and the plates, I'll provide more substance to my 1 star review. My reason for using Driveway.com was that I test drove in person a dozen cars at Honda dealerships near my home. I knew exactly the car that I wanted, but I just couldn\u2019t find it near me. I found it on Driveway and so I took a gamble. Looking back on it now, I should have settled for the purple version of the exact car I wanted at a local dealership. Or just kept looking locally.Simply put, if Driveway was the only place to buy a car, I would walk. Or buy a horse.Initially Securing the Car:I purchased the car with a combination of cash and a loan directly from my credit union. To secure the car, you need to show proof you can pay for it. The $500 deposit does not secure the car for you. My car was on a Honda dealership lot in New Jersey. Driveway reps were pushing me to get them proof I could pay ASAP. I had cash and pre-approval in writing from credit union. That was not enough, they said. The dealership will only hold the car if they have a pic of the actual check from the credit union. The problem is the credit union requires the VIN# and their check is based on that exact car. See the problem? There\u2019s a gap in securing the loan and that car even being available. Someone could have walked on the lot in Jersey and purchased the car I just took a out a loan specifically for. At the time, it was really stressful, and the Driveway reps didn\u2019t see this as a problem and seemed to wish I was financing through them directly (at a much higher interest rate). The car was available after I got the check from the credit union and the car was available, but I think I know why.State of the Car:Nobody was going to buy this car in person at the dealership. The reason? It stinks. It smells like someone chainsmoked four packs a day in the car. This was not disclosed prior to purchase, so please if you buy a car from Driveway ask specifically if the previous owner was a smoker. At one point in this process, because Driveway reps were not providing me information and I believe were stalling in order for my 7 day grace period to return the car was over, I reached out directly to the dealership. I asked the salesman, \u201cAre all the cars on these online companies stinky cars?\u201dHe goes, \u201cNo, no \u2026 we also have new cars.\u201dThat\u2019s all I\u2019m going to write about that.Communication Breakdown:Despite the stink, the most frustrating part of the experience was the communication. Throughout this process I communicated (either via text, email, or call because it seemed to depend on their preference not mine) to no less than 13 Driveway employees.Some of these individuals were nice and good at their jobs. Others I could tell had no idea what they were doing. I don\u2019t blame them, I blame Driveway for setting them up to fail. Each department is siloed from one another. Nobody knows what\u2019s going on at any point. And I never knew who to reach out to. Every other day a new Driveway rep was texting me or calling me to introduce themselves. I\u2019d follow up with that person, and I\u2019d be told oh no that\u2019s not the right person.Some of it was entertaining. At one point they told me they were shipping the car from Jersey to Massachusetts to a local dealership and a third party driver would bring it to me. That plan changed because they must have figured out Connecticut is between Jersey and Massachusetts. On a Monday, I got a call directly from a delivery company telling me they\u2019d be there that night. But then no car that night. Nobody reached out to me to tell me it wasn\u2019t coming, I called the # the delivery guy called from and he goes,\u201cWe\u2019re not coming tonight. They didn\u2019t tell you?\u201dThere was also a funny/scary moment when a Driveway.com rep called me and asked without any prelude, \u201cAre you wiring the money?\u201d\u201cWhat? I sent you two checks. A certified check and a check from the credit union.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re here.\u201dAt this point I\u2019m having a heart attack. Few moments later.\u201cOh. Here they are. We\u2019re good.\u201dThere was a lot of this type of thing. My 2022 Civic came with the manual for a 2011 CR-V. Driveway sent me a 2022 Civic manual, despite their rep telling me I could just get the manual online via my phone. I insisted and they sent me a manual.When the manual was on its way to me, a rep told me they were sending me a link to my original TrustPilot review. \u201cIf you could update that to 5 stars.\u201d\u201cYou want me to change my review from 1 to 5 stars?\u201dThey said that would be great. \u201cThese reviews are how my performance is determined.\u201dMind you, this was before my plates or registration were in my possession.

The passenger side headlight housing was also damp and mildewed, so obviously, there was a leak in the seal.  These issues were not visible in pictures prior to purchase.  That night, I drove the car home from work along highway one with one headlight and no working high beams.  How do you sell a car with one headlight out and no high beams???  I called Driveway that night and began the frustrating process of trying to get someone to deal with it.  I was told to take it to Toyota as it was still under manufacturer warranty.  Toyota in Seaside was great.  They began the work and upon doing so, found that the car had been in a COLLISION.  The headlight housing was an aftermarket part from Turkey, didn't fit the car correctly and had been double sided taped in place.  The bumper had been painted, didn't quite match the rest of the car.  When Seaside Toyota looked into the Toyota company service history data base, they found that the repairs on the collision were recent and were known to the Toyota dealership that the car just came from in Torrance.  They had sent pictures and told me that the car was \"just like new\".  The collision was not reported to Car Fax which was Driveway's comment to me, as if that made it ok.

Driveway.com (Lithia) agents and customer service are AWFUL. Lithia dealerships are AWFUL. And both work in conjunction to screw the customer (just as they did me). I was actively lied to and deceived by both Driveway agents and dealership employees. Both Driveway and Lithia work in conjunction to utilize the Driveway site as a platform for unwanted new vehicles ONLY. They only list vehicles that have been sitting for MONTHS (usually 4+mo) on their site. All their other new cars they hold off of the site so they can extort customers in person at their dealerships.A deeper dive: 1) Dealerships REFUSE to post their cars on the Driveway site (their pictures sit with \"coming soon\" status for MONTHS on the site-- you cannot buy) -OR- 2) they only post them when the cars have \"lot rot\" (they've been sitting on the lot for months-- the kind of car that's been neglected, not been run, & you don't want to purchase). Furthermore, two different Lithia dealerships and several Driveway agents have LIED to me outright/repeatedly about the conditions for purchasing, the price/fees, the Driveway process, if the vehicle was available, etc. As soon as you show interest in a new vehicle on their Driveway site the dealership will yank the vehicle from the site and conspire with Driveway agents to pretend that they vehicle already sold. All this because dealerships DON'T WANT YOU TO BUY FROM DRIVEWAY. They make more money if they sell the car from their store. Then, after yanking the vehicle, they will post only older \"lot-rot ones\" whose prices have magically increased by several thousand dollars more than the one you showed interest in. Just to spite you and extort you.OLD REVIEW: I previously praised Driveway. Boy was I wrong. Driveway is the WORST experience I've had from any dealership ever. All the worse because you have to deal with TWO layers of lies-- those from Driveway agents, and those from the physical dealerships. Here's the breakdown: if you want to buy online, use ANY other service including Carmax, etc. ***\"Your frustration and concerns are important to us, and we must find out which order you are referring to. The creation of a support request is the first step to have a direct conversation about your experience.\"---- False. I already created 2 support requests with Lithia Cares and have called and spoken with 4-5 different people at Driveway about this issue. No resolution, only gaslighting, denial, and the excuse that \"dealerships can act however they like, even if they're scamming customers, and we don't care.\" I provided them my name, address, phone number, transaction info, etc. and it did me no good.\"Upon doing so, a post-delivery satisfaction agent will work to determine what resolution options are available to you.\"---- False. I was never contacted by anyone from Lithia or Driveway. I had to call and complain EVERY single time. And they did nothing but excused the dealerships lies and duplicity.Hey Driveway: Instead of trying to get honest reviews like mine removed, how about you actually FIX the rot and corruption within your organization?

I found the perfect car; a used EV with only 13 miles. I was ready to go yet this process took over a month! I received texts and emails from different folks almost daily. They often didn\u2019t know what the other was doing. When I received calls from them, they couldn\u2019t even tell me a number to call them back! At one point I had 3 different people ask for proof of insurance - and they weren\u2019t even sure what vehicle they were seeking insurance for. The disorganization was so extreme that I wondered if I was getting elaborately scammed! There was no clear path to completing the process - no checklist or point-person explaining the next steps. Delivery was just as frustrating. I was contacted by (yet another) agent stating he was my delivery coordinator, and that my car was being picked up 6/27, and would be delivered to the local Lithia dealer (about 90 minutes away) on 7/1. The message was as follows: \u201cyour vehicle will arrive at delivery center on 7/1. Once there, it will go through inspections. When completed, we will order transport and will take 3-5 business days to get an ETA for delivery.\u201d At this point I\u2019d been waiting for this car for weeks, and I\u2019d already sold my old vehicle (to another dealership for more than TWICE what Driveway offered me), so I requested to pick it up, as it would be faster than waiting for delivery. He said I\u2019d be able to pick up Tues or Weds. I heard nothing Mon by 6:30 so sent a text. He responded Tues \u201cthere was a one day delay\u2026should be at our delivery center by the end of today.\u201d I asked him to keep me posted - didn\u2019t hear back. I texted again Wed asking for an update. He said my vehicle was still in transit. Again, I asked him to keep me updated. Again, no response. On Fri, July 5, I texted AGAIN, asking about my vehicle, and making clear my frustration. He said my vehicle was at the dealer, and would I like to schedule delivery or pick up? Since we\u2019d been discussing me picking it up for 10 days at this point, the question was just annoying - had he been paying attention to any part of this process? I arranged to pick up at 9:30am Sat 7/6. My husband and I got to the dealer at 9:30, as arranged, and explained we were picking up the Ionic from Driveway.com - they had no idea who I was or who that car was for. They said it showed up Wed and hadn\u2019t heard a thing about it. I received texts from Driveway asking if I\u2019d picked up the car yet. I explained that we tried and no one had any idea we were coming. He swears he sent 2 emails but the dealership says they hadn\u2019t heard anything. Once sorted, the dealership explained they ran their \u201cinspection\u201d when it arrived and told us the low tire pressure light was showing on 2 of the tires so they suspected it was malfunctioning, and one key fob didn\u2019t work. They did not try to inflate the tires, to see if they were, in fact, low. My husband and I checked them and, sure enough, all 4 tires were at 27 PSI. We filled them ourselves and the warning lights went off. We shared our frustrations regarding Driveway with our contact at the dealership and he was sympathetic, saying it seems to be the trend. He asked how things could be improved and I said I wanted a checklist, perhaps a personalized app that walks the buyer through the process. I said that having 1 consultant being the point person would reduce SO MUCH STRESS AND CONFUSION, it would streamline the transaction and the buyer would know which number to reach out to when questions arise. Additionally, that point-person would keep the buyer updated on issues/delays/paperwork needs/etc. In the end, we told the delivery agent a few issues: \u201cOne of the key fobs does not work\u2026The drivers window controls and child lock panel is covered in something sticky. The mileage was advertised at 13 total miles, sold at 36 miles, and yet when we picked it up it had 86 miles. Why the extra 50 miles?\u201d The agent said \u201cOk, I will put in a ticket to our resolutions team. Please allow 24 to 48 hrs for an agent to reach out to you about these issues.\u201d I have yet to hear from anyone. Additionally, the windows were covered in tape residue from the sales lot, the windshield was all bugs and grime, and the entire car had a thick layer of dirt. I expected to receive a clean car. Overall, there is so much potential for a pleasant experience via online car purchase, as it\u2019s so nice to avoid pushy salesmen.  Yet Driveway misses the mark over and over again, and I honestly missed the in-person sales folks. At least with them, you walk away with your vehicle that day, without the endless runaround!

They now won\u2019t reimburse me $236 for the rental car.   The car finally arrived  It was clear that the car had never been reconditioned by the dealer. The vehicle arrived dirty on the outside and somewhat dirty in the inside. It had a crack in the windshield which makes it illegal to drive.  It was missing a subwoofer and the electric tire pump.  I noted these items  on the vehicle delivery document (\u201cVDA\u201d) and  signed it. Then I searched for the temporary registration and a temporary license plate.  Nothing.  I contacted Lydia in customer support who told me that I would not be getting a temp title nor temp registration nor a repair to the windshield, a replacement tire pump and subwoofer if didn\u2019t re-sign their VDA  without any exceptions.  I live in a rural area and had no choice i need a car. So I signed it because I need to drive.  Lydia then disappeared.  I never got the temp title or temp registration. I couldnt legally drive the vehicle for one month until the permanent registration and title arrived in the mail.  But with the cracked windshield it still wasn\u2019t legal to drive. I visit the city quite often near where I live for work. I was unable to park in the city because I was unable to get a parking sticker because it requires a registration and title. For one month I had to pay $70 a night to park my car in the city. Then there is the tinting on the windows. Drivers and front passenger side windows are so darkly tinted. There\u2019s no visibility inside the vehicle. This is illegal.  At night I have to  roll down the windows to turn left or right because there\u2019s no visibility out of the vehicle on either side.

This car cannot legally be driven for several reasons,  come and get it.  Two days after the 7 day return policy they sent me an agreement to sign describing their return policy.  They wanted me to sign the agreement after the fact!!!They also backdated the sales contract 25 days before they dropped off the illegal car.  Somehow they modified the sales contract after I signed it. They determined I should pay California sales tax which is about $900 more than my state\u2019s sales tax.   They refuse to acknowledge this. There\u2019s more bad stuff but that should suffice. Though they\u2019ve never sent me any paperwork,   I don\u2019t even have a fully executed copy of the contract.

We dealt with 9, yes 9 different people about the details of our vehicle, after we purchased it.  There was an abundance of singularly purposed messages that consistently contradicted each other throughout this process.  A customer/consumer should never have to try and filter which differing message is accurate about a singular issue.  This happened over and over again, to the point that we both just became angry and still as I write this we are furious how we were treated and how the backend of this deal was handled.  While going over the contract on the phone I made myself very clear with I believe \"Jake\" regarding GAP and that I absolutely did not need it and would never purchase from a dealership.  We discussed a few more items and then he sent over the Signnow/Docusign or whatever platform it was.  I immediately noticed a $900 charge for GAP.  I texted him immediately and told him he knew I said no.  No response, none.  I then had to ask my Wife who she was currently talking with regarding our deal, she indicated it was \"Justin\".  So at that point 2 people were dealing with us in a different manner about the same vehicle and same contract.  I called Justin and he said he would fix it (no apology btw).  I got a text back from \"Jake\" that I asked for GAP, I was angry at this point and called him a liar which he didn't respond to.  During that same day we were told by two different employees, one of which was \"Nate\" (the absolute worst person involved in this) that our vehicle would HAVE to stop in Atlanta before it was to be picked up by a 3rd party delivery truck, then coordinated with us to set up delivery.  THAT NEVER HAPPENED.  My Wife got random texts from an unnamed employee that had pictures of the vehicle, approx 2 days later.  No words just pictures.  My Wife sent it to me and I asked why was this sent?  She didn't know so I texted and after a day the person responded with \"this is what was sent to me by the dealership\".  Absolutely no explanation about any of it.  I wanted clarity about what was happening with the vehicle, it had been 2 days and no updates, including the website (touch on that awful site next).  We realized pretty quickly there was zero direct contacts for anyone at all.  Again, going back to having so many different people about one issue and those messages being different, tracking down any of them with a general contact (email/phone/chat) are very very negative for a consumer/customer.  I was told on the phone after being transferred twice that our rep was \"MJ\", we had never heard of that person until that call, they also were not available to talk.  I was told we would get a call back, didn't happen.  We waited 2 more days, the website still only showed \"order is in!\".    Over the next few days we had no updates, the website had not updated and were just waiting for clarity on where exactly things were.  On Jan 29th at 5:43pm I get an email from Issac Jospeh that our vehicle is being delivered tomorrow, the 30th.  I responded with \"In Atlanta, correct?\"  He responded back with, no it will be at your house tomorrow, it isn't going to Atlanta.  I emailed immediately back how this differs from everything we had been told and wanted to make sure that was the case.  He did not respond, so I sent another email asking to please verify if that is true.  He responded the next day with \"Your Delivery Coordinator is contacting you soon\"  I asked him who this person was, he indicated it was Nathan.  We last heard from him 8 days ago when he sent us random pictures of the vehicle.

However, my journey to \u201chappily ever after\u201d was cut short because there were too many hoops to jump through. Online car buying is all about trust and after all the unexpected twists and turns in Driveway\u2019s clunky process, I no longer trust them to deliver a high-quality vehicle. ProsBetter prices than the competitionMore options since cars come from dealerships across the countryMuch of the work is done virtuallyStaff is friendly enoughConsComplicated/confusing process:It would be so helpful to give customers a list of what they can expect during a car-buying process. I\u2019m new to online car buying so I didn\u2019t even know what questions to ask before we got started. A detailed, specific list of what I can expect would have gone a long way toward making the process smoother. I imagine it would eliminate many of the frustrations fellow reviewers have left for Driveway. Waaaay too many people contacting me and through too many channels:It would be amazing to have one point of contact who communicates with me about everything. Instead, I had 4+ people texting, emailing, and calling me about different parts of the process. Many of their communications were blocked by my phone or sent to \u201cjunk\u201d in email, so I couldn't easily tell what was spam and what wasn\u2019t. And if I had a preference on how they should communicate with me, it didn\u2019t matter because I\u2019d get texts, emails and calls/voice messages for most interactions. It\u2019s better than no communication, for sure, but it got confusing where I was supposed to look for documents, links, etc. That said, it seems like Driveway would benefit from a better CRM system. Even after I\u2019d started the purchase process for my car I was still getting sales calls from people trying to help me find a vehicle. It felt like a classic case of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing.No consistency in how I submitted documents:I had to send documentation to different places. I\u2019d upload my driver\u2019s license to a website here, then email my insurance to a contact there, then sign contract paperwork through another site, and eventually mail other contract paperwork through snail mail. They told me the process only \u201cseems complicated.\u201d If this process ain\u2019t complicated, folks, I don\u2019t know what is.Extra costs:I confirmed that if I returned the vehicle within the 7-day return window, I wouldn't have to pay extra to ship it back to the dealership. I'd be out the initial shipping cost, but no additional shipping fees. I did find a restocking fee in the contract paperwork that the dealer wanted to charge if I returned the car, but I never figured out if Driveway would cover that cost or if I would. All I can say is pay close attention to those details to make sure you don't end up paying more than you think.It\u2019s not all online:Maybe I\u2019m na\u00efve, but I thought buying a car online wouldn't require me to do things in-person (for the most part). Turns out, some paperwork has to be mailed to me so I can take it somewhere to get notarized, then send it back to them via snail mail. That requires time off work which begs the question - does it save time over going to a local dealership?Too many third parties and affiliates:I even had trouble with the company they used to verify my identity. Since my phone\u2019s permission settings are strict, it wouldn\u2019t let me open the link they texted and emailed. I tried troubleshooting via the third-party company's website, but they only have basic troubleshooting info that\u2019s outdated and doesn\u2019t apply to many phones. It took an hour just to figure out how to do this simple part of the process since Driveway didn\u2019t have a workaround.Typos in the legal documents:I know it\u2019s a little thing, but c\u2019mon y\u2019all. Let\u2019s dot those T\u2019s and cross those I\u2019s (or, wait sec\u2026). If your legal documentation isn\u2019t up to snuff, it does not bolster my trust in the company. It makes me feel like you won\u2019t pay attention to the details of my car either.All in all, I spent way more time on all of this than I would have if I\u2019d gone to a local dealership.

I highly recommend you go through CarMax, I didn't have the same awful customer service, some folk were willing to help but the greed at the top isn't appreciated, example being that they were pretending that the car I wanted wouldn't be available to me because the dealership was waiting on getting the title when in fact they were just trying to get them to finance with them instead of taking a much cheaper finance option through my credit union. How did I find this out? I called the dealership myself when I smelled greed from them saying that my car isn\u2019t fully secured even though I put down a security deposit. The dealership said this was untrue and let me know that the title was gonna arrive in a week and a half tops. The dealership was absolutely appalled and I called them on their bluff.

I've spent countless hours trying to talk to someone to alleviate and tell me the truth on how things are going but it's like pulling teeth.

Driveway.com placed a transport ticket, 3rd party long haul transporter arrived at the dealership without prior notice and the dealership handed over the car. Driver called me and we setup a delivery on Tuesday morning (1/30/24). Driver arrived very punctual but that's the highlight of the experience. From that Tuesday morning, I called Driveway.com, tried the chat service, the NY dealership and the individual who I UPS'd my documents to within Planet Honda a dealership in NJ. The receptionist in Planet Honda gave me the cell number of a lady called Andy from Driveway.com. Andy worked the phone to finally determine what needed to be done so I could get tags for my car. I later found out my documents had been sent to the wrong individual which delayed the delivery of my tags more. On Thursday, I was finally told my tags would arrive on Friday morning. So I had a car without tags, that I could not move for 3 days but I was happy the tags would be arriving the following day, Friday Feb 2nd. I thought the drama was finally over but Thursday afternoon, I receive a text from Issac in Driveway.com's DMV department that took me over the edge. His text read,\" He learned that my tags will be arriving the next day but unless I signed the VDA I would not be getting my tags. I have been refusing to sign the VDA form because I received a car without tags that I could not use. Now, I was being strong armed to sign or no tags! I sent a very vocal text back and a second asking for a callback immediately. Once Issac called me, I let him have all the frustration this company and it's mediocre employees practices deserved. I made it extremely clear that if I did not receive my tags, as I had been told, I would call to return the car Friday morning! Then a second employee from Driveway.com called a few hours later once again requesting a signature or the tags would be stopped from arriving. I responded in the same forceful manner as earlier. I expressed my situation of having paid cash for a car, received no tags and could not sign the VDA which clearly stated the Driveway.com car return guarantee would start the day of delivery. If I signed the VDA I would be losing 3 days from the company 7 day/400 mile guarantee, I asked for the guarantee to start the day I would receive my tags, 2/2/2024. They refused, so I didn't sign. I received my tags yesterday as promised, Friday Feb 2nd and have not signed the VDA because they are still not wanting to correct the date on the form. So it seems I called their bluff and I got my tags, these 2 employees had no authority but they had no real desire to rectify their internal company error, either. I will sign the VDA once the true 7 days have passed. FYI, I learned that unless the VDA is signed the sale is not credited toward the month sales, this is why they were hysterical over my signature and didn't wish to help make me whole. Be very leery when purchasing from Driveway.com, I might just use their site as a research starter and contact the dealership directly next time, cutting the middleman out!Lastly, I want to make it clear I tried to.get these entry level employees to patch me through a higher level employee but they wouldn't and I also tried to post my experience on X.com and that too was ignored. So I gave Driveway.com multiple opportunities to make this right, they chose not to!Update (2/5/24 @ 11:45amET):So I had a Driveway.com Customer Satisfaction Team employee contact me via text at 11:45am ET. Sarah is wanting to discuss further in an attempt to improve the company response for future clients. I responded \"Absolutely would love to\". I will await contact and further edit this review if pertinent.Additional Update: (2/6/24)I had a very productive conversation with Sarah Chambers today. She was very apologetic and seemed honestly interested in my experience with Driveway.com. Sarah was wanting to get as much details in order to address with upper mgmt, so ultimately this could serve as a teaching moment for the staff as a whole. I can appreciate a company that admits a mistake, wants to learn from the situation and attempts to make right by their customers.

Once they have your money they refuse to speak with you. I\u2019d like to specifically mention Contract Analyst Jennifer Liwanag as being particularly committed to providing the worst customer service possible. Anything involving driveway will be a waste of both time and money. Hopefully the government cracks down on scam organizations such as this one.Edit: 2/27/2024 So someone from Driveway reached out to me in reference to this review. This was fortunate as today was the day I went to the DMV to get temporary tags for my car. Of course, in spite of having \u201call the documentation needed\u201d to get this done the DMV was unable to do so because Driveway doesn\u2019t have the title to the car yet. I spoke with someone from Driveway and they said this was due to me needing a VIN inspection. (This was of course not communicated to me until I asked about it). I was then told I would have to drive my (unregistered) car to the get the VIN inspection done. I\u2019m not joking. When I pointed out how insane that was the alleged customer service representative stopped responding to me. I have no idea if I will ever get my car registered. I work almost every day and do not have time for this. Driveway.com is the worst organization I have ever had the misfortune of doing business with. I wish I could just return the car but unfortunately I really need it (registered or not) and cannot be without a vehicle for any length of time. Do not use their service. It is way more inconvenient than any other method of buying a car and they will charge you a fat delivery fee for the privilege of them lying to you and refusing to provide any customer service whatsoever. I\u2019m half wondering if I have a lawsuit on my hands. STAY AWAYEDIT: 2/28/24 I had to take time out of my extremely busy morning to get the VIN inspection done. I was of course never informed that I needed to do this until I was finally able to contact someone to complain about how Driveway.com prevented me from getting temp tags yesterday. I would just like to reiterate that Driveway.com is the absolute worst avenue for buying a vehicle. They will do everything in their power to make the experience as difficult as possible and you will pay extra for the privilege. They have no compunction about taking your money, providing no customer service and then doing NOTHING to resolve the issues they create. Edit: 3/13/24 Yet another update to my endless quest of trying to get Driveway.com to do their jobs. I emailed Sarah Wolf, the \u201cCustomer Satisfaction\u201d person I\u2019ve been assigned, regarding the status of my cars registration. It\u2019s been 24 hours and she has failed to return my email. I sent in my VIN Inspection document over a week ago (2 day shipping). At this point describing this organization as incompetent would be far too charitable. They are outright refusing to do their jobs or provide any sort of customer service whatsoever. I am still being forced to drive my car illegally and I have no idea if my car will ever be registered. I am taking steps later in the week to see if there is any sort of legal action I can take. I didn\u2019t think my opinion of this organization could sink any lower but I was wrong. This is the worst business interaction I\u2019ve had in my entire life and that includes being robbed at gunpoint. STAY AWAYEDIT: 4/4/2024The nightmare experience with Driveway.com predictably continues. I\u2019m still waiting on my plates and reg. After being told (when I contacted them, they never contact you) I would have my plates  last week I was informed this week (a week after I was supposed to have them) that DRIVEWAY IS FINALLY IN POSSESSION OF THE TITLE to the car they sold me. Sounds illegal but what do I know. The upshot of this is they can finally register my car and get me my plates. The ETA for my plates to arrive is 3 WEEKS FROM NOW. Not a joke.I didn\u2019t think it was possible for Driveway to one-up themselves at this point but I was wrong. It\u2019s been well over a month that I\u2019ve been forced by them to drive my car illegally. This has negatively affected nearly every aspect of my life. They don\u2019t provide updates or even seem to acknowledge how badly they screwed me over. Had I been able to get the temporary tags that I wasted time trying to get (I couldn\u2019t get them because Driveway didn\u2019t own the vehicle they sold me) they would have expired by now anyway. I really hope this is my last edit on this post. Never use Driveway. They charge you a hefty delivery fee, their customer service is non-existent, they do nothing to try address their (numerous) mistakes and they will force you to expose yourself to legal consequences. They are the scum of the earth. I wouldn\u2019t recommend their service to my worst enemy. They have put me through more stress and inconvenience than I can fully articulate here.

They do not deserve the one star I'm forced to provide in order to write a review.We started our process 6/8/2024. It started rather smoothly and fast. I placed the order for our truck and put in the order for our trade. I put the $500 deposit down and had returned the DMV paperwork by 6/14/24. I got the paperwork notarized and sent the paperwork and was noted as received on 6/18/24. I was so hopeful that everything was going to go smoothly from there. However, I was very wrong. I was informed the truck was to picked up on 6/21/24 and would arrive at the hub near my house on 6/25/24. It was almost the end of the day on 6/25/24 and I had heard nothing in regards to the truck. So I was texting with our contact questioning if the truck had arrived. He had informed us that it would be by the end of the business day. 6/26/24 same thing. I called into the driveway help line. Again got the same answer. From 6/25/24-7/5/24 everyday was the same routine. I would either text or call to find out the status of the truck. Every single time I was told it was due to arrive by the end of the business day. As you can imagine I was frustrated. I would ask can you at least tell me where the truck is at this time? The answer I would always get was I have to check with logistics and we will get back to you by the end of the business day. Which would never happen I would have to call again for any kind of info. Finally, towards the end of the week of 6/28/24 I was told the truck transporting my truck had broken down not even out of the county where my truck was picked up but it would be fixed by that Saturday and my truck would arrive on 7/1. As you guessed it we did the same little dance that day as well. No one could tell me where the truck was but it would arrive by the end of the business day. At this point I am starting to believe I have been scammed as a loan was already opened up on this truck and I have yet to have the truck in my possession. 7/5/24 comes around and I have talked to every single person imaginable at this point. Where is the truck?? I was told another truck was sent to pick up my truck and it would be here at the hub on 7/8/24. It was nearing the end of the day 7/8 when I heard the truck had FINALLY arrived to the hub. In hopes we would have the vehicle that day,  of course we did not. The morning of 7/9/24 the truck finally arrived at my house and the trade was taken. Trade wise I signed over the rights to the vehicle back on 6/14/24 with all the paperwork agreeing no more miles would be placed on the vehicle. Thank goodness we had another vehicle to drive during this time. The truck itself was exactly what we were looking for and were just so relieved to finally have the truck after the ridiculousness of no one knowing what was happening. So we thought that the chaos had come to an end....NOPE. Our temp tags were expiring before all the information would be switched to the PA DMV, the $500 deposit refund, and the trade payoff were all a disaster. Every single thing that needed done I had to hound them to get it accomplished. We were out of luck regarding the temp tags and were told to just carry all the paperwork with us. The $500 deposit that was supposed to returned after the drop off of the truck, I had to call them and ask them where it was. After 3 days of arguing the fact and showing them it was to be refunded, they finally agreed to refund the deposit.. as it says on their site. They picked up the trade on 7/9 with the drop-off.

This was not a pleasant experience at all.  I would sell my car for 35% less than this brain draining, illogical fiasco, called \u201cour policy\u201d.  First, they did not have a driver in my area. They did not tell me this when I signed the papers,    You are told not to drive the car and they will have someone contact you for car pick-up.  In the meantime, you have no vehicle and you are still making payments. You are still paying insurance.   They will have people call you from so many different numbers that you can\u2019t even determine what is legitimate calls.  I signed the papers to sell my car on April 24th. After calling several times telling them that I needed a vehicle and they were staling,  I received a call on Friday, May 3rd by one phone  number that they wanted to pick up my car the next day, which was a Saturday.  I had plans with out of town company.  I cancelled and my husband went with them and I  stayed home to meet the person.  I waited and got a call that I was not answering the phone fort the valet pick  up person.  The person calling was another number and the ID was for a landscape company.  This made me even more nervous.  The driver came and was very professional.  He left with my vehicle on May 4th.  I was told the ACH to pay off my car would be sent on Saturday, the 4th.  I called on Thursday, May 9th and was told the ACH goes out after 3 days. The receipt they sent me showed a request date of May 6th, and the bottom said expected pay-off May 9th.   The funds were received and processed by my lien holder on May 10th.  My car payment was made on May1st.  On May 1st, Driveway had no idea when my car would be picked up.  I have auto pay. I was told the exact amount on the bill of sale would be sent to my lien holder and any overage would be refunded by my lien holder.   Driveway updated the pay-off and sent  my lender the lower amount.  A difference of $1,007.03 and now they are telling me that I will not get that money from them for 4 weeks, after the title is cleared.  I asked, \u201c why can\u2019t I get my money\u201d.   \u201cIt\u2019s policy\u201d,  was the response.  Keep in mind, had they given me advance notice of a pickup time, I could have stopped the payment, however, I would have been late as it was the 10th when the money was with the lender.  It is not logical to me that, had I not made my payment, they would not have funds to hold hostage.  However, because I made my payment and they did not remit the full funds to my lien-holder, I am now waiting at minimum 4 more weeks to buy a car.  Again, this is \u201cpolicy\u201d.  This is how we work.   So, you can expect a fully consummated deal to take about 6 weeks if you have money coming back from payments.    I trusted they would send the full amount on the bill of sale to my lender and I would be refunded by them. This is what I was told.    I trust my lender and was not concerned about the payment being returned upon receipt of payoff.  Chase refunded me a small amount of $100 overpayment on May13th.  That is the same date I would have received the $1,007.03 had Driveway, sent the full amount they collected  for a payoff.  I will now have to wait the 4 weeks or whatever else, their illogical  \u201cpolicy\u201d is to get the remainder of my money.  They have no logical reason as to why they can\u2019t send it now.   I regret the day I heard their name.  I had no idea this would take so long.  I could have bought a car from a local dealership on April 21st, and traded in my vehicle and have made a 1st car payment, before this deal will be fully consummated. Be prepared to have another mode of transportation while they work \u201ctheir policy\u201d.    I would never, never, never do this again or recommend.  A great idea, however, very poor execution.

I then had Brooklyn reach out to me and I told her what my budget and everything was. I initially was approved for a KiA Sportage LX I got a proposal from the care team and everything. The only issue was I didn\u2019t have my paystub handy so they wouldn\u2019t let me proceed with \u201csecuring the car\u201d and I put quotes for a reason because the damn deposit doesn\u2019t mean anything. So a week later I contacted Brooklyn again because she told me to save her number and I said my paystub didn\u2019t generate as of yet but she informed me that the Kia was sold so she looked for other cars. I did another application for a 2015 Jeep Cherokee. This particular car didn\u2019t require a paystub which was weird but hey, my car was stolen, I have a small child and I need a car. After I sent my $500 deposit to \u201csecure\u201d the car I went on ahead and actually purchased insurance. They only need a snapshot of a quote but I went ahead and purchased a policy because why wait? I was going to have a car at least I thought. So I\u2019m looking through my policy and noticed the car I \u201csecured\u201d had an open recall with the code 2V33800 which meant from what I read that it\u2019s a fire hazard and that the car can explode while driving and parked potentially insuring myself, my child, whatever passengers in the vehicle along with those close to it. I proceeded to text Brooklyn and let her know this situation asked if the dealer can fix it because it said something about an electrical wire issue. I texted her through this whole process because I was taught to keep everything in writing. \u201coh no! I didnt notice that... I dont think there is a remedy for it right now. The dealership just let us know its not available. So I am thinking we find something that doesnt have this issue\u201dMY RESPONSE : \u201cThe car isn't available?

I can have my sales manager transfer it and see what kind of approval we can get and then use your same documents and deposit for it\u201dAlso her \u201c I can look for some others as well its up to you\u201dShe also said she can refund me but I really need a car so yeah. Me: \u201c Okay you can do the transfer please\u201dAlso me: \u201cI really need a vehicle\u201dShe proceeds to say she will work on it now I say pls lmk what the payments are going to be because I told her what my budget was before hand literally a week prior and she told me it was no issue. She said she\u2019s going to work on it. I start switching original jeep to a jeep compass after seeing there was no open recalls I send her a few text messages after thanking her for letting me know she would try her best to keep my payments low or around the same as the original jeep.

The paperwork was signed by the dealership and my down payment check was made out to Jeep Only, so one would assume they would want to rectify the problem. I contacted Driveway immediately, and was told customer service department would handle it and contact me ASAP. The delivery company acknowledged their driver made an error, but no other response. Now on day 4 I still have not been contacted by Driveway, the dealership, not the transportation company. Terrible buying experience! Also, it won't shift into 4WD because of the ABS error, AND, the transmission is leaking...on a supposed \"CPO.\" I've submitted a complaint to the BBB in hopes to get help in resolving this issue because I don't know what to do because I don't feel the vehicle is safe to drive.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Terrible", "text": "Once they have your money, communication becomes sparse and ineffective.

Driveway motors collects your money directly for Title and Registration fees required in your County.  Then in return holds onto YOUR money for weeks or months before sending it to the DMV.  This is hundreds of thousand of dollars being purposely or negligently held. You as the consumer are now entirely at their mercy. 2. If Driveway cannot provide you proof within a couple of weeks of purchase they have sent the required title/fees/registration any future attempt to contact them directly will be futile.

Notify Driveway/Lithia/the dealership you expect immediate resolution. Once.  4.

They told me it was pristine and attempted hide the severe body damage with sharpie. The AC also didn\u2019t work. When it arrived, I was livid. Gouges in the paint, scratches, hail damage, no AC in 90 degrees plus high humidity. They wouldn\u2019t cover the cost of repairs for the body damage (upwards of 5k in damage) so I immediately started the return process. More hoops to jump through. And THEN I find out that they aren\u2019t going to give my trade in back when they pick up my return. The return has to get shipped off to wherever the seller determines, inspected, and then approved. THEN they approve the release of my vehicle, and then they have to arrange transportation back to me. I got the run around from both Driveway staff and Lithia Motors. Both kept saying the other was the one I needed to talk to and deferring responsibility. PLEASE do not put yourself through this.

Documentation and deposit submitted immediately; congrats- just need to get the loan. No one contacts me since taking my $500. Five days pass, I call and my car was sold to someone else.

I had to call three times to get my $500 back (to be clear,  my sales rep still hasn\u2019t contacted me- I was helped by random associates when I phoned the general number). The only way I got my money back was because I told them I wasn\u2019t getting off the line until my refund was processed with confirmation sent to my email.  Fast forward, two weeks later.  The same car is back on the site for sale again!  I call about it.  They tell me that it is likely that the other sale fell through.  I initiate another purchase.  The supervisor of the sales rep who didn\u2019t get back to me says I will be contacted in the morning to confirm the car is available and take my deposit.  No one calls me all day.

The entire process dealing with this company has been awful. The initiation of a vehicle purchase was easy enough. The representative seemed pleasant enough and set the expectations for the entire process up front. However, every single expectation set would be broken. I told them from the beginning that our family vehicle was totaled so speed of delivery was off the essence and I was assured the entire process would only take a couple weeks, tops. 1. I was first told that the vehicle shopping process would begin when the deposit was paid only later to find out that was not true. The vehicle would not be shipped until the down payment was made. This was only the first delay. 2. Once the down payment was made i was told that the vehicle should be delivered within a week, but maybe up to 3 weeks with June 16th being the very latest. It was stated numerous times that it was incredibly unlikely to be delivered as late as the 16th. Spoiler alert, it wouldn\u2019t be delivered until well after the stated time. 3. The vehicle was delivered to a facility about 6 hours from my home on June 5th. I was calling nearly every day to get updates. I was told that the vehicle needed a couple quick inspections and should be delivered by the end of the week. 4. I called every day that week and was told there was no new information. That Friday, the 9th the person I had been speaking to was out of the office and the person I was directed to told me that the back bumper had been damaged and was going to be fixed but nothing had been done, no parts ordered, nothing all week. They had known about this issue since Tuesday the 6th. I was told the following Monday that I could forgo the repair since it was so minor and have the vehicle shipped, expedited, and get a check to repair the small damage. I went with that option.5. That whole week, no progress was made. I called and spoke with a supervisor that Friday, the 16th. I was told that \u201cremember how your decided to expedite delivery and take care of the repair when the vehicle got to you\u201d\u2026 \u201cwe just didn\u2019t do what we said we did.\u201d The bad news was that there was still no idea when the car would actually arrive. The good news, I was told, was that the repair was done. They still had no eta for delivery going into the weekend. No one assigned to deliver the vehicle, nothing. And this was the day that I was told at the beginning of the process the vehicle was guaranteed to be in my possession. 6. The following week I received a call from the delivery truck saying my car would finally make it to me. It would be delivered\u2026 midnight Tuesday the 20th. Midnight!? Who the hell delivers vehicles in residential neighborhoods at midnight? Either way, the car was finally delivered but the trouble was far from over. 7. The rear bumper was still damaged even though I was told that it was fixed. In fact, the repair being completed was the reason I was given for delayed delivery. I had to call and spend yet another few hours speaking to customer service. They said they\u2019d issue a check to cover the repairs. I also was reached out to by the tagging/titling department and was told to get a state inspection (which I was told was already done previously\u2026) and my property tax receipts and email those to them. I had to pay for the inspection out of my own pocket and sent the documents. A week later I was emailed and told that I actually have to sent the physical inspection paper to them. And of course the way they wanted me to do this was through UPS, the nearest location being 40 miles from my house. 8. Finally after jumping through all of their hoops, I called to follow up on the check that was promised to cover the repairs and\u2026 \u2026 I\u2019m being told that there was some issue with that and it may or may not be fixed. Don\u2019t go near this company. It\u2019s so much more convenient to go to a dealership and dmv personally.

Has Driveway reached out to us to schedule a delivery?  No, no they have not.  We now have a car payment, no car, and still no understanding of where our vehicle is or when we MAY get it.7/19/2023 - 10:30 am Pacific Time. We were contacted by Driveway this morning with a confirmation (finally) that they had received the funds from the bank (which were released LAST Friday (Today is Wednesday) - we have been told that a delivery agent will be contacting us later today to arrange delivery of the vehicle.  Will that happen?  Let's find out.--11:00 am - we had to call because we've received no contact as of yet.  Was told that an agent would be calling us back in 30 minutes.  Stand by for more:--11:35 am - We had been told that Patrece from Driveway would call us by now.  We've had no contact as was promised.  Stand by for more: --11:45 - FINALLY received a call from Patrece who stated that they DO NOT KNOW WHEN THEY CAN SCHEDULE THE DELIVERY!!!!????  This is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!!!!-- 12:00 pm - We managed to contact the contracting person who confirmed that the car IS in our city, and that the delivery coordinator SHOULD have been more clear that she needed to check and make sure that the car had been cleared with the Nevada DMV (which according to the notes was accomplished on 7/15).  The administration is in the process (or so they claim) of getting us the sales contract copy (which we should have already received but didn't) so we can get the car insured and get a temporary moving permit from the DMV.  Driveway is one of the most uncoordinated, inefficient, mismanaged companies I've ever had the displeasure of working with.UPDATE 1 pm 7/19/2020 - after having my wife on the phone with Driveway, and me on chat with Driveway and informing them that we'd be filing a complaint with the BBB, we nearly immediately received a text confirmation that the vehicle will FINALLY be delivered today between 2:00 and 3:30 pm.  I will update you again with the status of the vehicle, its condition, and the delivery experience.UPDATE 7/20/2022 - We received the vehicle.  All is good with the car itself.  However, we now face another dilemma.  We still have not received back our $500 deposit.  We were told that we would either get the credit towards the car purchase (which did not happen) or we'd receive a refund (which has also not happened) - Additionally, the registration fee which we were charged (which we were informed by the delivery person) has not been refunded as Driveway will NOT register the car and by NV law, we are required to do so.  So, as of now, Driveway owes us $1,028.59 in refunds which we have yet to receive. - The saga shall continue...", "rating": 1}, {"title": "SO Irritated with this company", "text": "SO Irritated with this company.

This is by far the worst experience i have had.Initial process was relatively smooth...a little slower than I wanted, but acceptable...until I submitted my initial $500 deposit.  Then it was like pulling teeth to get anything done.Paperwork was repeatedly sent to me with errors...which I was assured would be fixed later.  Sorry, if I'm going to sign something, it needs to be correct.Then, I had to keep on top of my contact to find out when delivery could be arranged.  I was on a time limited rental from my insurance company due to my previous vehicle being totaled.  Ended up shelling out for 25 extra days of rental because the paperwork and delivery process with Driveway is painfully slow with few to no updates unless I asked.  One person I messaged with with said he would help me submit my rental paperwork for possible reimbursement, but never heard back on that.Vehicle arrived....with a slow leak in one of the tires (seems to have happened to others based on other reviews).  I was just happy to finally have the vehicle so I let that go.Then, I discovered there were no floor mats in the vehicle...even though the dealer's listing clearly states \"Front Floor Mats\"...I have a printout to prove it.  I contacted Driveway about that, was given the run around that the dealership management would be looped in....again, no follow-up after repeated attempts on my end.Then (as many other have mentioned in reviews) my temp tags were getting close to expiring...so I asked about the status of my registration transfer and title.  Again, given the run around and delays...then found out my registration had NEVER been submitted to my state's agency...my state requires this happen within 21 days of purchase...this was well beyond that timeline. No solution offered...they can't issue a new temp permit...so I couldn't even drive my vehicle for over 2 weeks...no offer of compensation or a rental...just \"sorry\".  Not good enough.  I did finally get my registration, thankfully it showed up in the state's online system the day I had to leave on a major trip...and it arrived from Driveway while I was gone.To this day (almost 4 months later) I have yet to receive a copy of my vehicle title.  I guess I'll have to pay the state for a copy.  Not worth jumping through Driveway's hoops (again) to get any action.Oh yeah, and they charge a $699 \"Documentation Fee\".  Nice little hidden charge there...and WELL above the market rate of $100-200.HORRIBLE experience.  I will strongly recommend staying away from Driveway.com.  They don't care once they have your deposit.  Customer service is some of the worst I've experienced, especially considering I paid $699 to have my documentation processed...then they dropped the ball numerous times and I had to prompt them to file it.So, if you want a potentially damaged vehicle without all the features in the listing and don't mind not being able to drive your new vehicle for a while when they don't process your paperwork, then go for it.  I'll look elsewhere in the future.  Bye, Driveway.UPDATE:  I find Driveway's response to this review less than satisfying.  It's full of corporate jargon and platitudes.  How about taking care of the issues I presented.  1) Send me the title for my vehicle 2) Provide the missing floor mats 3) Refund  the inflated Documentation Fee since documentation was a major failure on your end.  Then we can have a conversation.  These \"pain points\" are in many reviews here and on other platforms, so they should already be addressed.  Please stop giving us canned responses and let us know what action you are taking to solve these ongoing issues.UPDATE - 1 year later: I still do not have the title to my vehicle, never did get those floor mats, and have not be compensated for the lack of timeliness in processing my vehicle's paperwork. :(  Dropping review down to 1 star.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Bought Car 6 weeks ago on Driveway.com", "text": "Bought Car 5/23/23 on Driveway.com (Lithia Motors)  only able to drive it for 3 weeks on temp tags.

Silly me! The exact same issues that other customers were having, I had them as well. So be prepared... nothing about this process is fast.

Be prepared to have the documents that are sent to you notarized. Be prepared to not have an accurate delivery schedule. And most importantly, be prepared to have your car delivered without a temporary tag. Supposedly they will take care of that part for you, but who knows how long it will take to receive.

He ensured me that it would be taken care of and I had not received the information need to personally give him a call and he would take care of it.

This was a major inconvenience for multiple reasons: 1. Throughout the entire process, I was told by multiple representatives of Driveway that everything would be taken care of and everything would be mailed to my home. 2. My work schedule is the exact same as when the circuit clerk is open, Monday-Friday 8am-4:30pm.

Upon not receiving the documents by 6/16/23, I followed up with Deshaun and he responded that he would check on that for me; which later that day he got back to me and said \"he had gone back and forth with the dealership all day\" and the vehicle would take longer than expected to arrive.

First noticed that the car I placed an order for was no longer on their listings. Usually it says \"sale pending\" when you have started the purchase process, which again, I did, with a order number, and I watched the vehicle status change to \"sale pending\" after I started the process last week. Well come to find out the vehicle has been sold to another \"shopper\". Yet there was no communication to me about deposits or anything to actually hold the vehicle. I was told they were still awaiting a financing response. However, on my account still shows my order, with order number, and still waiting for \"next steps\". The $500 deposit does nothing to hold the vehicle, not that I was even asked for it, and the representative today, David, pretty much said sorry it's first come first serve and you should look at multiple vehicles to ensure you can get one if multiple people are looking at the same vehicle....what?????So let me get this straight, I place an order, I am pre-qualified, the vehicle changes to \"sale pending\" because I PLACED the order, yet no communication on what's going on, and poof! The car is sold to someone else or somewhere else??? But he was so gracious enough to cancel my order for me so I could continue to shop for other vehicles?? I didn't tell him to cancel the order, I wanted to know what was going on, and if the vehicle had ACTUALLY  been sold. I say this because there are other vehicles, same make, model, etc. That are still showing \"sale pending\" from last week when I was looking at them. So how are those still going through the \"finance process\" but my vehicle has just vanished with no communication or response from Driveway. Essentially there is NO way to hold a vehicle you want, you could place as many orders as you want, but if the financing process on THEIR end doesn't come back quickly then oh well your vehicle just goes to someone else..is that what a \"refundable deposit\" should be used for? So a customer can lock down a vehicle THEY want, until financing gets approved, if the financing doesn't work then the buyer can get his deposit back and the vehicle go back up for sale? Guess that would be smart...So in short, the vehicle I order, that I was ready to put a deposit down for, willing to wait the long period of time for delivery, was somehow sold to another \"shopper\" without any communication to me and my order canceled without my request..", "rating": 1}, {"title": "We got our order on May 24 2023 and\u2026", "text": "We got our order on May 24 2023 and wired the total amount for the car.

I purchased the vehicle with an approved loan from my credit union. This became on issue when completing the sale as the pre-approved loan was noted as paying cash for the vehicle. This \"supposedly\" delayed my registration processing. After waiting 5 weeks after vehicle arrive, with a now expired temporary tag, I talked with five (5) different individuals before receiving any answer about the vehicle registration. I was told that the process was delayed as the sale was done as a cash sale and/or DrWy's accounting dept had not provided proof of purchase / check to the DMV department. The DrWy rep told me I could drive the car without legal registration, and should I be pulled over and ticketed, DrWy would pay for the ticket. And  the points on my driving record - how would DrWy handle that? (so DrWy encourages breaking the law of one's state?) After discussing with the DrWy rep, the very next day, I received a txt from another rep stating they were contacting me to assist with my purchase. Again, who is managing the call center database information? I contacted DrWy again asking about the registration. I was informed it was being processed. Then I receive an email noting \"paperwork has been submitted to a local DMV\". A generic response as they did not even note the state. And a timeline of \"next few weeks\" was provided; it is now 6 weeks since I purchased the vehicle and I can no longer legally drive the vehicle. And the email provides NO contact information so there is no one I can discuss with.  As for the local DMV, I went to my DMV office and the vehicle is not listed in the state's database, so I cannot receive a temporary tag from my state. Purchasing the vehicle was simplistic...once DrWy received my monies, horrible! I am now paying for a car I cannot drive. I recommend not purchasing from DrWy.Conducted follow-up call. Told that call center is unable to transfer me to talk with a live person dealing with registration. I was informed that my information was with the DMV and my tag would arrive between 9 -16 JUN. Yet, as noted before, DMV does not list the car as being processed for or actually registered.  Was told that my information would be passed along and \"someone\" would contact me.

I will never do an online car purchase again. This company bounces you around to so many people who \"sound helpful\", but just pawn you to someone else that's either a voice-mail or they \"conveniently\" disconnect you.We purchased a 2015 Honda Odyssey, Touring Elite, white,  5FNRL5H97FB004409 from John Eagle Honda of Dallas Dealership. We were heavily assured in the beginning that driveway.com has a thorough inspection process of their vehicles and that we would be part of the process in knowing anything before the vehicle is shipped. Which we were not informed of anything. So we assumed that meant the vehicle was in good, working, and safe shape.After our vehicle was delivered from Dallas to San Antonio, I'm looking at the vehicle. The back seat is tilted back (off of the lock track)And we spent 30 minutes trying to get the seat locked in. My kids sat in it, and the entire bench seat in the back falls backward from the floor base. The lock is broken. How did this vehicle pass inspection?Also, when we drive it, it miss-fires as though the spark plugs need replacing. And the driver door doesn't stay open. It slams on my leg as I'm getting in. We can not safely drive this vehicle. Let alone drive it because my kids can't even sit in the seats without the seats anchoring to the floor.Who do we talk to about this?This is so frustrating for us. We were never informed of any of these things not working with the vehicle.When we started this entire process we were informed all recalls would be dealt with and  it would have a thorough inspection before releasing it.Please tell me how this vehicle will be fixed. We understand what an \"as is\" vehicle is, but this isn't even a drivable and safe vehicle.I'd like to take it to a local Honda dealer to fix the door, seat, and spark plug issue. And have driveway compensate for these repairs. As we were not aware of these issues and can not see how this passed a thorough inspection. This really stinks because we've waited a month doing this process and we were supposed to fo out of town this weekend. We've been without a family vehicle due to a car accident. Which is why we were purchasing to begin with. And we can't even use it.We were also told temporary tags would be in the vehicle (after I specifically asked if they would be) and there aren't any temporary tags.I give two stars only because the vehicle was very clean inside. No fault to the dealership, but when we received the vehicle it was so dirty on the outside it was as though the car was covered in mudd filth due to the drive from Dallas to San Antonio.(May 10, 2023 UPDATE)We had a Honda dealership do a Multi Point Inspection to this vehicle. And were absolutely apauled that we would be given this vehicle to begin with. They sent a video of how terribly unsafe and bad this vehicle was under the engine. And I only wish I could share it. Instead I will provide the list of the over $8,000 bill that it would take to get this vehicle fixed. Which I would never do because the engine itself shakes and shifts back and forth while driving it because the engine mounts were broken and one was missing. The entire engine has been hanging on threads. And Driveway.com along with John Eagle Honda were okay with putting my 4 children and husband at risk while driving this terribly unsafe vehicle. Driveway.com reassured us numerous times that their vehicles get thorough inspections. And by the time it would make it to us would be at least 3 inspections to be sure we were getting a safe vehicle. It looked as though someone recently replaced and put a new oil pan in and they snipped the wrong wire and just left it hanging there! The video showed all of this.

And therefore I must express my utmost disappointment and frustration with driveway.com. My recent experience with this company was nothing short of a complete and utter nightmare. They attempted to sell me a car that had been involved in a serious accident, a fact that was conveniently left undisclosed on the listing. Furthermore, the car was listed as \"Certified Pre-Owned\" initially on the website and the carfax report. After I put down the deposit, the carfax was somehow updated to remove any mention of it being Certified Pre-Owned, and the manufacturer (Kia, in this case) was not able to confirm that the car was actually certified.When the car was delivered to my home, it looked much worse than the low-quality website pictures could have even suggested. Deep scratches everywhere, and the interior smelled like a Port-a-Potty. To make matters worse, upon test driving the vehicle, I stumbled upon a shocking discovery\u2014a receipt for thousands of dollars in repairs tucked away in the center console. The description of the repairs mention that the car arrived by tow truck with \u201cbig body damage to the front\u201d. The repair shop replaced multiple components, but didn\u2019t do the body work. That body shop receipt was nowhere to be found, but I can only imagine how many additional thousands in repairs that involved. It's impossible to believe that no one at driveway.com or the associated dealership (Kia of Round Rock) had any knowledge of these repairs prior to the listing of this car. It became painfully clear that driveway.com had intentionally misrepresented the condition of the car, painting a false picture of its supposed quality.I find their actions to be deeply unethical and misleading. As a consumer, I trusted driveway.com to provide accurate and transparent information about the vehicle I was interested in purchasing. Instead, I was confronted with a damaged and poorly maintained car that was far from the pristine condition promised on their website.This blatant attempt to deceive customers is nothing short of a betrayal of trust. The undisclosed accident and subsequent repairs not only compromised the safety and reliability of the vehicle but also left me questioning the integrity of driveway.com as a whole. How can a company with such little regard for honesty and transparency be trusted with such an important purchase?I implore anyone considering doing business with driveway.com to proceed with extreme caution. Their deceptive practices and disregard for customer satisfaction are clear indicators of an untrustworthy and unethical operation.

Driveway said because the dealership stated the AC was working when they tested in January that it is my problem. On top of dealing with this I have been waiting on plates for my vehicle. My temporary tags expired and I was told that I could get a temporary tag from my state. Which is incorrect after I went down to the DMV to find out about temporary tags.

It is 5/30/23 after finally finding the perfect car for me on 5/21/23 Briana was super sweet in helping land the deal and send over initial paperwork immediately, but after paying the $500 deposit fee, it took someone 6 days (5/27/23) to finally reach back out in regards to contract signatures, payment, etc. Mind you nobody was able to talk about numbers with me until someone from the financial department was to contact me (6 days later). I guess another one of my biggest confusions about this whole purchase is that I have to wait for paperwork to come in the mail and then have it notarized and then sent back?

This was a mistake.  My husband and I both purchased vehicles from Driveway on 4/17/23 and 4/19/23.  The vehicles were delivered 4/27/23.  The process was smooth until this point.1) Both of the vehicles were missing a required inspection for our state, driveway response was that sometimes this just happens, and we had to take time off of work to get the inspection and send it via UPS to Driveway.2) Both vehicles had mis-matched or missing keys.  3) the biggest issue, the vehicles did not come with temp tags (due to our state).  The temp tags in our state are only valid for 30 days from purchase, which was 4/17 and 4/19.  Driveway did not send the paperwork to the DMV until 5/2 for perm plates.  When questioning them on whether or not I will receive the plates in time, Driveway stated that they use a third party DMV company, and that they say the processing time in my state is 4-6 weeks.  There is nothing they can do.  This is just an excuse.1st, I purchased a vehicle from Carvana previously, and I had temp tags and all needed paperwork prior to my temp tags expiration, so it can be done.2nd, my son purchased a truck (with an out of state title as well) from a dealer at the same time... his title was back within 2 weeks.3rd, Driveway leadership is aware of registration issues, but continues to ignore the issue.  As a company, you cannot pass blame to a third party which you have contracted with because you have the ability to change the process to fix the issue, or to establish SLA's in order to allow your customers to be able to legally drive their vehicles (back to the 1st point).  4th, when I mentioned this to Driveway, the response was.. we have a responsibility to the lien holder (driveway finance).  I understand that; however, you also have a responsibility to your customers.  Their priority is themselves, and not their customers.  We are paying for a vehicle in which we are unable to drive because of poor processes, inadequate leadership decisions, and inability for them to take ownership of their decisions.  Purchase from someone else, the cost of the delays and issues surpass any discounts from purchasing from Driveway as well as less stress. No tags, no plates still as of 5/26/23.**Edit for reply to Driveway**Your response is the perfect example of inadequate processes and leadership vendor choices.  Had the registration process be completed effectively (as Carvana does) I would have plates and legally drive the vehicle.   No plates equate to tickets if driving because it is illegal regardless of the paperwork to have in the car.   There is no excuse if other dealers can accomplish this.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "I would give it a negative stars if I\u2026", "text": "I would give it a negative stars if I could.

The documentation process was very slow (the contracting agent took a couple of days off without any notice to me). Found many mistakes in the documents and asked to correct them multiple times.2. The original delivery date was Apr 15. I got a call a day before from a transporting agent. She asked me to reschedule the delivery date because the temporary tag was not ready, so the vehicle couldn't be drivable. I agreed to reschedule for Apr 17 and submit my day off for it. I got a call again from her on the delivery date. She said my temp tag was still not ready. She said it already shipped out and it would be delivered to my home address directly on the day or the next day. I believed it and received the vehicle (The delivery guy parked in my indoor garage). They never provided the temp tag tracking # until I get the car. (Delivery guy delivered the vehicle and temp tag tracking #). The temp tag wasn't shipped yet when I checked the tracking#. I finally got the temp tag on Apr 20. I had to call Driveway a lot to figure out where the temp tag was. (They re-sent the temp tag) 3. I found many DAMAGES from the vehicle when the vehicle was delivered (Apr 17). Windshield CRACK, Paint chips (not fine scratches), wheel scuffs, missing air vent tab. The delivery guy took pictures but I didn't hear anything from him since then. 4. (Apr 20) BRAKE vibration and driving Assist camera malfunction were found on the first test drive. This is CPO vehicle. I can't believe the vehicle has many obvious issues. 5. I contacted Driveway to ask them to cover all damages (except paint and wheel) because all damages came with the vehicle. They kept saying all damages could be covered by Manufacture/CPO warranty. I contacted the local Mercedes dealership and got confirmed all damages are NOT COVERED by Manufacture/CPO warranty.Interestingly, they started saying they sold the vehicle AS-IS (I keep this message as a record) but were willing to assist $350 for a fix. I denied and showed them the warranty document (100% parts and labor covered) then they never mentioned it again. The CPO inspection document clearly states all points are passed. (all damaged parts included) How passed?6. (Apr 21) A Driveway agent, Stephen asked me to drop off the vehicle at Lithia Mercedes dealership near my location for a diagnostic report. He mentioned he would reimburse for the diagnostic fee. I keep all his messages.7. (Apr 21) I contacted the local Lithia dealership that Stephen suggested. The dealership said the earliest appointment was Apr 26 which is later than the 7-day money-back period. I told Stephen what I heard and my concern. He directly contacted the dealership and then asked me to have Apr 26 appointment. He would get the Money back guarantee period extension filed on his end. 8. (Apr 26) I took another day off for the appointment. Let Stephen know after dropping off the vehicle at the dealership. He replied he would let me know when the dealership contacts him. However, Stephen NEVER responded to the dealership and my calls/messages since then.9. (May 2) The dealership sent RO to another Driveway agent, Amber Key. She forwarded the RO to the selling dealership. When I asked her the update she said the selling dealership DENIED to fix the damages. She told me they were willing to assist me $1k (asked me to replace the windshield from 3rd party, not from a dealership) for all damages instead of covering them.10. Replacing OEM Windshield itself cost easily more than 1k. Did I make all these damages? Why should I pay for them? I bought a CPO vehicle, why should I get 3rd party parts? The document \"Buyers guide\" clearly shows on \"Dealer warranty\" and states the dealer will pay 100% parts and labor.11. (May 3) I requested RETURN the vehicle because they don't fully cover the damage even though it was already damaged before delivered to me. Amber DENIED because 7 day return period is already passed. I sent her a screenshot of what Stephen told me. Stephen ASKED me to schedule Apr 26 appointment and drop off the vehicle. He also clearly mentioned he would file the money-back guarantee extension.12. (May 3) After Amber saw the message, she told me she would call back after checking something. I messaged her to get an update after an hour but she never replied. I called Driveway again and another agent told me she's just left, so leave a message for the callback tomorrow.The issue is still going on and my car is still in the dealership.

I told him the dealership was DCH Honda of Temecula, CA he said he would call and see what the approval rates and financing would be and call me back. I\u2019ve never been called back. I reached out by chat again and they told me I could call or email the customer service and get someone to help me. I emailed because I can\u2019t really call where I am and I received no response. I would just like to know what the world is going on at this point. I need a car and my credit isn\u2019t the best since I\u2019m getting back on my feet after losing my job and everything but it said I was approved so I thought things were looking up. Now today the car says it\u2019s unavailable which from the FAQs part of the website apparently means it\u2019s sold? If it wasn\u2019t sold to me and I was the one person that had the car pending because it approved me, then what happened to my car?! Why haven\u2019t I received answers? I want to try again and maybe see if I would have better luck with a different car or something but I\u2019m weary after reading the reviews. So far this process leaves a lot to be desired and I\u2019m afraid of trying again just for them to actually take my money and leave me hanging this time instead of just leaving my hanging. Guess I should take it as a bullet dodged but I wanna know why? And I really need a car and they seem to be the only online dealer without overly priced cars and decent down payments but then again I wouldn\u2019t know since I never received next steps or a package about what I would have to put down anyway. I give it one star for now unless I miraculously haven\u2019t gotten ripped off by now.

My new car also required a minor repair during the 30 day warranty limit, and I have to give a shout out to my assigned team member Lidia, who was great to respond to messages timely and seamlessly coordinated the repair with the Lithia dealership near me. \"Driveway completes all of the registration paperwork for your purchase, and this can be a rather lengthy and anxiety-producing process.\" When I wrote this in my original review, I had no idea what I was in for. It has now been 2 months since the transaction and the car was delivered, and the registration is nowhere in sight. Even so, there has been no update or communication from the company unless you reach out to them when your temporary tag is in danger of expiring. My second temp tag expires in less than a week. I have now called twice and spoken to a different person each time. Today I heard that there was a problem in the process, and they have to petition the FL DMV for a duplicate title. Did they lose the title paperwork? Did the care they sold me not have a valid title? There is no ETA when this duplicate title will be obtained. I was assured on the phone that they were working to get me a third temporary tag, but they have to get permission from the state for this as well. There is no guarantee this temp tag will arrive to me before the current one expires on Tuesday. This is an absolute nightmare. Their workflows obviously do not work, and their business model is atrocious. You can never speak to the same person twice once you get to the registration part of the process, and the agent you do talk to can only put a note into your account indicating your issue. They have no power to do anything to help. They don't connect you with anyone who can. Look at any review website and you will see the same problem happening to nearly every customer. I wish I had noticed them before making my purchase. This is very similar to the issue that has come out about Carvana. I see a similar class action lawsuit in Driveway's future.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "I thought carvana was bad but driveway\u2026", "text": "I thought carvana was bad but driveway has taken the crown.

While searching the internet for different options, I came across Driveway\u2019s website. They had some options that interested me, and I decided to go for it although their online reviews were a mixed bag of highs and lows. I usually give people the benefit of doubt and so I decided to give them a chance. Most of my communication with their customer support was via text message that made it simple. I went through the initial purchase process that included the selection of the vehicle a $500 down-payment and having my credit run. Everything seemed good to go until  I requested a status of my order. I was told the vehicle had already been sold. I was a little bit confused about how I secured the vehicle with the down payment and how it just disappeared. This was Strike 1 for me. At this point, my wife already suggested to me to move on, but things happen sometimes and I decided to give it another try.After some back and forth with customer service, I agreed on another Tesla that had a great price. Based on the images on the website, the vehicle appeared to be located at a Kia Dealership in Frisco , TX. Again, I basically had to completely re-apply for this vehicle and my credit was run again, which I didn\u2019t mind because I was sure this would be my car. So after waiting for a few days and wondering why my order status had not changed, I contacted customer service. After going back and forth for several days and endless messages, the final statement was that there was an ice storm in Texas and the dealership was closed for a week. I was able to confirm the ice storm via the news and again, I told myself things happen and to be patient. I few days later, after not receiving any updates, I contacted  a manager (or so I hope) who assured me the vehicle was secured for me. I was satisfied with that for a while. Several days passed again with no updates and movement of my order status, and I was forced to contact customer service again. This time I was told the purchase was stuck in financing. At this point, I was like whatever, and I told myself to be patient.Then around the 02/10/23, I received a telephone call from financing and I was told I would be sent paperwork via email to e-sign within the next 20 minutes, and I would be sent paperwork overnight to physically sign. I did not see any paperwork or hear anything again for the next two days. Finally running out of patience, I contacted customer support, and they did not have an answer for me. I was told I would be contacted as soon as an update was available. I did not hear anything again for another two days and I decided to contact customer support again. This time I demanded to speak to a supervisor. Instead of a supervisor, my assigned customer rep contacted me. The rep told me that he just received an update and that the deal had fallen through because the dealership where the car was at had stopped communicating with them. This was Strike 2.I told the rep I was pretty upset about the situation, but I wanted to give them another chance. I asked the rep to find me a similar vehicle for the same price and financing options. The rep got on it right away and he located a very similar vehicle, and that was about $1000 more expensive. I figured whats a thousand bucks when you buy a car, and I went for it. Again, I had to re-apply for this vehicle and my credit was run again. About an hour later, I received the offer, and I finally believed we were on the right track. But to my amazement when I looked at the offer, my monthly payments were over a hundred bucks more and the APR had shot up significantly, I confronted the rep with the last offer I had a screenshot of and the current offer, and I told him this was unacceptable. I pointed out the vehicles were very similar in almost every aspect, but now I was told to pay a hundred bucks more a month that worked out to be quite a chunk of change over the time of the loan. The rep apologized, and he told me he would talk to the sales manager to make the financial offer close to where we were on the previous one. A few hours later, the rep messaged me that they were unable to offer me a similar deal and that my $500 would be reimbursed. Strike 3.At this point I did not even reply, and a short time later I received an email that told me I would receive my money back in 3 to five days. That same day, I ended finding a car on Vroom and I got way further with them in 20 minutes than I did in a month with Driveway. I am super disappointed by my first online car-buying experience that was supposed to be easy. My impression is they have a major issue with real-time communication with the dealership, resulting in car being already sold before they even know it, and keeping in touch with customers. Their order status page also needs to have more information on where it is in the process.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Driveway disaster", "text": "Driveway disaster. Sometimes customers complain even after not doing all that they need to do to get the job done. That is not my case. I read the horror stories about Driveway and still decided to give it a shot, thinking I'll simply cross all the t's and dot all the i's, which I did, and everything will work out. I couldn't be more wrong. Driveway just doesn't get what it takes to get the customer to the finish line when someone purchases a car from out of state. Which is nuts because Lithia Motors, owner's of Driveway.com, has locations in 28 U.S. states; 17 locations in NJ alone. I understand if I bought a vehicle in-state I could drive it home - REGISTERED - that day. I didn't mind the idea of making the trip to NJ DMV for the vehicle I bought. My vehicle was delivered on Feb. 8, 2023, with a chipped windshield and filthy. I was told the repair company never showed up to repair it and that I could take delivery and get reimbursed for the windshield repair. I've yet to get it repaired because I was thinking of returning the vehicle just because of the way things were unfolding. I went to the DMV the morning after delivery with the paperwork that Driveway said I needed to register the car in NJ; not even close. A NJ DMV clerk gave me the necessary form for registration and I passed it on to Sarah Chambers at Driveway. The form has all the necessary instructions that NJ requires, pretty simple transaction. Not for Driveway. Now I wanted to proceed with the return because of the way she was handling my situation. I held off because it looked as though I'd have temp tags in a few days. Not the case. Now the return period is over and I'm stuck with an unregistered vehicle.  No one buys a vehicle to have it sit - unregistered - for weeks. I say weeks because that's what I was told how long it will take to get my vehicle registered, ETA March 10. I'll get the windshield repaired in the meantime and see if I get reimbursed.

I noticed a clicking noise from the engine but since it was still under warranty (10,225 miles)  I figured it was probably not an issue.  However at the 15K mile service I asked about it and found out I needed a NEW ENGINE which took three weeks to get parts and install.  Fortunately it was covered by the warranty. Driveway (Lithia) states that they did a 160 point inspection, I don't know how a mechanic would have missed this noise and the fact that the oil had metal debris in it.   I will never use this company again and strongly suggest others avoid them as well.To Driveway's reply.  Yes they did issue a check. This was do to the fact that I had to call them numerous times and take the truck in twice to get it weighed because they kept missing the deadlines they set to send me the papers.

Sounds great, but ultimately the model does not work.  I have bought two cars from them and each has had major issues in the process:In the case of the first vehicle, I ordered a vehicle at the price quoted on their website - something they call the \"Driveway Price\" i.e. they don't accept negotiation - only to be told that there was an additional $5,000 of dealer markup that had not been included in the online price - so I am not allowed to negotiate, but they are able to add $5k after the order?  It took me basically escalating this issue via social media for them to ultimately honor the original price.In the case of the second vehicle, every time I tried to order, I was told that the listed vehicle was not actually in stock or had already been sold.  It took several weeks and repeated calls for them to be able to find a vehicle that was actually in stock.   Then it took them over a month to figure out how to get the vehicle from the dealership in Texas to my home in California.   Now, 4 months after purchase, and 3 months after receipt of the vehicle, I do not yet have title, registration, or license plates.  I have been chasing them at least weekly to no avail.   The latest update is that they finally submitted the paperwork to the CA DMV 3 weeks ago, but failed to submit the required amount to pay for the registration so the DMV rejected it.  Now they have to resubmit it and we go round once again.  Through it all, there has been zero proactive communication on their part to keep me updated.  I only find things out when I call them repeatedly and insist upon updates.At heart, the issue with this business seems to be that the online sales portal is completely unconnected to the actual dealers.  So the listings on the site are out of date or non-representative of dealer stock and, when you do finally find a vehicle, the onus is on the individual dealer to follow up with Driveway itself seemingly having no sway over the process - and since you are an out-of-state sucker that has no ability to show up on the doorstep of the dealership or to hold them accountable, everyone blames everyone else and nothing gets done.  And the folks who answer their service lines don't seem to have any sense of urgency or concern at their issues.I am crossing my fingers that I finally receive the registration.  My insurer is threatening to cancel my insurance given that I have no way to prove ownership or registration.

The car also has obvious clutch issues but they wont look at that because it apparently isn't covered under warranty.

This is supposed to be a legal document, is one page, and they couldnt even get spelling right? I immediately reached out and they did correct and send to me again within a few days. I had it signed and notarized and sent back on 12/16. At this point, my temp tags were expired so I cant drive the car. I was given some documents and told to go to my local DMV to buy a new temp tag. The DMV informed me that is not how things work and I was not given a new tag. I let Sarah Chambers, a supposed resolution specialist, know and she advised me she would research more. That too happened on 12/16. I am now being ignored. I have a few emails sent here with no response to them. Sarah did respond but didnt even remember she said she was going to look at temp tags and basically said \"too bad, cant help\".

Since then it's been something between a chore and a nightmare. For several days after we ordered the car and made our deposit we heard nothing--despite my having sent several emails--from Driveway until I threatened to cancel the sale. The delivery process moved rather quickly, albeit with another significant lapse in communication, but since then things--especially the registration process--have slowed to a painful crawl. A full three weeks after we purchased the car, one of their agents contacted us asking that we re-sign several papers. (We have copies of those papers so they seem to have simply lost them, but we still haven't gotten a clear explanation as to just what happened.) Apparently, the \"missing\" documents had held up the registration process, which, of course, no one from Driveway bothered to tell us about in the three weeks since the purchase. Nearly a week later they finally asked for proof of insurance. After countless conversations with agents who are apparently unable to do anything--including passing information to decision makers and/or following up even after they've said they will--almost two weeks passed when, just today (Dec. 12), a person supposedly from Driveway's DMV department emailed me to ask whether I'd taken the car for an emissions inspection. It's an electric car. After I advised the agent of this set of basic and easily obtainable facts, they told me that the process (which one?) would take three to four weeks. Someone from Driveway will publicly respond to my review on this forum--see others here--and will say they're sorry and someone's on the case, yada, yada, yada. None of that will enable me to drive my car legally since, of course, my temp tag, like that of many others here on this forum, has expired. (The DMV in my state says I won't be able to get another one.) Because of Driveway's incompetence and/or apathy, I am now and for the foreseeable future left with thousands of dollars worth of unusable equipment. This company apparently lacks either the ability or the inclination (both?) to conduct business in a way that honors its agreements with customers or complies with the law.

Thanks looks like I won't be having Christmas this year.Since I can\u2019t reply to Driveway\u2019s reply, which I think is very strange, I am forced to reply back to their comment through my initial post. They know they failed every person that\u2019s on here complaining about them. Driveway, smart enough to know that you don\u2019t go and take peoples money and not deliver what was promised you don\u2019t go and take peoples money as a deposit and then if they decide in the end that it wasn\u2019t the right fit for them, decide to keep it anyways. That\u2019s not only unethical, but I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s the first rule you learn in business 10. I want to be fair and say that by the mere handful of positive reviews a terrible experience hasn\u2019t been the case for everybody, however, it doesn\u2019t take long to see that it has been the case for most of the people who chose to review and this is just me speculating, but I\u2019m assuming they probably came to review this company because they couldn\u2019t get a response back from them any other way, the exact same way they did me. It seems like the wide majority was scammed because either their money never got back to them or they spent money on a car that they cannot even legally drive because this company didn\u2019t fulfill their obligation to the customer by not getting the customers their cars on time and for many it seems like they chose not to go to the DMV and get the customers their tags, the very things they promise you. And if I\u2019m just being 100% honest, it\u2019s very sad to know that the only way to get driveway to speak to me is through reviewing the company on a public forum. I guess the only reason why I got a response or anyone probably get a response is because of the companies concern about how they\u2019re are coming off to the public, and so it seems they must change this narrative that actual customers are saying about them by projecting this image upon the public that they cannot believe this happened and if they\u2019re so sorry when the reality is there, not sorry at all, they can\u2019t return no one\u2019s phone calls they can\u2019t just send you back your own money even though it clearly states on their website that it is a refundable deposit we\u2019re talking about the eighth largest automobile company in the entire world. Yes I googled that that is worth billions of dollars and you can\u2019t refund somebody that\u2019s out here can\u2019t even afford Christmas. They\u2019re a little measly $500 because I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what that is to you but instead you choose to keep it and then you want to come on a public forum and defend yourself as if you care, be real with yourself you don\u2019t care you\u2019re taking peoples money you\u2019re not delivering on promises you\u2019re getting rich off of us, and then you have the audacity to act like you care your company is built upon lies and theft. It\u2019s also funny that I replied back saving my number even sent an email yesterday after you replied back to my initial post. I haven\u2019t received anything back from this company and it\u2019s been over 24 hours funny how a company that claims to care so much you would think after receiving a review such as mine that they would I don\u2019t know make an effort to say something to me. I got nothing cause that\u2019s all this company is nothing. I say this because I don\u2019t want no one else to be in my position and have their money taken from them or be like other customers I\u2019ve seen on here that get cars they don\u2019t even get delivered on time and then when they do, they don\u2019t even get their tags and can\u2019t even drive the car they just spent thousands of dollars on legally please be careful and dealing with this company. Like I said there\u2019s clearly been a handful of good experiences, but the number speak for themselves and the common denominator with this company is that more bad happens than good and on a much larger scale if you divvy out the percentages of how many good experiences people had against how many bad I guarantee the number would be something like 90 to 10 please save your money don\u2019t even bother with his company because I\u2019m not gonna bother with you when things don\u2019t turn out the way they\u2019re supposed to or like they claim I\u2019m sorry driveway.

I said \u2018OK? They want to? Are they?\u2019 I never heard back. I got a call on Friday while at work from a delivery driver telling me he is on his way and will be at my address in 3 hours.The guy calls me roughly 3 hours later telling me he\u2019s lost on my road, so I happily agree to walk out there and direct him into my driveway. While I\u2019m walking out I\u2019m on the phone with him and he has his truck parked on the side of my road directly next to my driveway (I live in middle of nowhere with no other driveways near mine for a mile on either side). I clearly get his gist that he just doesn\u2019t want to back his trailer into my driveway or pull in. That\u2019s fine though, whateverI\u2019m standing near the trailer as he gets his ramps out (tire wide ramps) and he begins talking about how bad electric cars are (I bought a Tesla) and is just a totally unpleasant guy to be around. He puts the ramps on the trailer and gestures to me to pull it off myself. I\u2019ve never reversed a $60k car or ANY car off of a flatbed trailer IN MY LIFE, but I see no other option, I don\u2019t trust him to go anywhere near the car at this point. As I\u2019m backing the car off, he\u2019s watching me and I see him wince as the front bumper is moving over the ramps. I ask if anything scraped and he wouldn\u2019t say anything. So I wasn\u2019t sure at this point.I couldn\u2019t really tell if there was damage under the bumper or ANYWHERE on the entire front half of the car because it was COVERED in mud. Big old globs of mud had been tossed into the front of the car from this guys truck as there was zero barrier between his trucks tires and the trailer/car. He hands me some papers to sign and asked me to write \u2018no damage\u2019 by the signature. Then he says I need to sign on his phone, but he couldn\u2019t get the app open. So he says 'to he** with it', says the paper work is good enough for him. I said \u2018as long as it will all work out\u2019. He says \u201cI don\u2019t know if it will, all I care about is the paperwork\u201d and then he left.I checked the bottom of the front bumper once I got the car home and sure enough, under all the mud there\u2019s a big chunk of paint missing from the car scraping the trailer ramp. It was at this moment I realized the delivery driver knew 100% his trailer wasn\u2019t suited for this car.

I have talked to other Driveway customers who never even received the temp tags, so I\u2019m really hoping this isn\u2019t going to happen to me.Even if/when I get the temp tags, it's likely I'll have to park the car and leave it sitting in my driveway once they expire because Driveway is telling me it will take 3 months to get the title/tags.Do yourself a favor, avoid Driveway.com and Driveway Finance Corporation at all costs.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Started the purchase process on\u2026", "text": "Started the purchase process on 11/22/22 and I keep getting the run around regarding when the vehicle will be ready.

I think it's appropriate to write them regarding your problems, and list this site as a reference point to show the number of us experiencing the same difficulties regarding missing Titles, defective vehicles, ect. The BBB website has 17 pages of consumer complaints regarding this company, ALL addressed with form letters from the company that acknowledges their complaints but offer no solutions.  If you're one of the many who have cars sitting in driveways, storage, or on the street that you can't drive because of missing Titles, contact your representatives and make them aware of these problems.

All of your transactions will take place in your state (my vehicle was delivered to WI from Texas, a fact not disclosed until after they got my money), you can actually talk to the person(s) handling your purchase, and finally, you can handle all disputes locally.  There are a lot of red flags when you see so many people here dealing with the same issue,  Titles.  From what I can gather, this company operates out of 3 states, TX, ORE, and another that's unknown to me.  What I DO know is that so far they've worked the same way a \"3-card Monty\" does. You know, that guy on the street that challenges you to guess which card is the Ace. They simply bounce customer complaints from point A to B to C, all the while hanging on to your money.  Again, this company is a complete and total scam, despite the \"good\" reviews you may see elsewhere.  Protect yourselves, protect your money.

As of 12/17/2022 I STILL have not received my title, and haven't been able to drive my car to work since 11/30/2022.  It's winter, with temps in the teens. I've seen the replies from Driveway regarding not being able to get in touch with owners because their calls were screened.  But I had to laugh despite all the hassle when they wrote back to him on this site, saying \"We will remind our colleague that there are more ways to contact a customer besides a phone call\"...like....email???  I haven't received a single email since I began asking for my paperwork in earnest.  Yes, a class-action suit is in order, and I would be more than willing to join it at this point.  Please, give this company a wide berth.I purchased a 2011 Kia Soul from this company (TX) back in September of 2022. As of today, 11/23/2022, I have STILL not received the Title for the vehicle despite numerous calls and emails. The temp tags expire on 11/30, at which point I won't be able to legally drive the vehicle.  I learned after contacting Driveway that there was a \"cross-out\" on the title, and according to them, this was the cause for it being rejected by my state's DMV here in WI.  This first-time online purchase has been a complete clown show, and I'll ALWAYS buy local going forward.  At this point, I'm looking at hiring a lawyer and trying to get a refund/court costs.  Avoid this company, because as you can see from the other reviews, I'm not the only one experiencing this issue. UPDATE: I received a response from this company, requesting that I send them all my contact information. This is AFTER I purchased a vehicle from them, and it was shipped from TEXAS to WISCONSIN on a flatbed truck!  These people have everything about me short of whether I've been circumcised!!

I'm pretty sure the \"positive\" reviews are fake. I've literally been shuffled around between 4 sales associates and managers for weeks. Now that I've put my deposit in NO ONE is answering me at all. The contracting department was supposed to be in touch...but, crickets.Even more concerning is the vehicle I have been told is secured with my deposit is still available for purchase on their website instead of being listed as 'sale pending.' Last night, they dropped the price on my vehicle. Will this change be reflected in my paperwork (if I ever get any)? Shouldn't it?I've found discrepancies with the odometer and Carfax. I've been told the mileage will be confirmed and my 400 mile test drive will start when they drop off the keys. Conviently, the discrepancy is just about 400 miles. Did someone else try to buy this vehicle, drive it and return it and they are intentionally misreporting the mileage so as to not allow the buyer the chance to find out what's wrong with it? At this point, I would expect so.With all the red flags partnered with all the bad reviews, I'm thinking I should cancel the transaction.UPDATE 11/15/22: Sales and mgmt both got in contact today. Yes, they are honoring the lower price. But the vehicle is STILL available for purchase on their website...why? I asked sales what will happen if my car gets towed due to expired temporary tags...twice. I did not receive an answer to my question but was told they now have a DMV department to make the process better.UPDATE 11/16/22 5:59am CT:Just checked the website. The vehicle I've secured with a deposit is STILL FOR SALE! It's been five days and they are still advertising my car. Unbelievable!UPDATE 11/23/22: The car is now listed as 'sale pending' on the website. Taylor had me get insurance yesterday. I wanted to put the start date as Monday 11/28/22 but Taylor insisted it must be yesterday. So now I have insurance on a vehicle I have not signed any paperwork on and no guaranteed delivery date. Tomorrow is Thanksgiving. Who wants to bet I don't receive any paperwork until after Monday? I used DocuSign to get my insurance. Why can't Driveway offer the same?...later that night...No one from Driveway got ahold of me at all today. So I'm literally paying insurance for 6 days plus that I should not have. I knew nothing would happen until at least Monday. This \"company\" is slower than molasses. I knew no one would do anything on my purchase...that's why I said I'd date it Monday. Ridiculous!11/26/22 3:37pm PT:Documents arrived for eSign today just after noon with expiration at midnight. So many issues I had to reject both contracts. The most concerning issues are a required signature on the \"Exercise of Guarantee\" which is to ONLY be signed if you're returning the vehicle. My $500 deposit was not listed on any documentation. They were trying to get me to pay a $500 restocking fee (while simultaneously requiring me to cancel the contract). The contract was not the agreed upon price. And in anticipation of me signing my money and car away, they lowered the price another $400. This is criminal! They know I am disabled and they are hoping to take advantage of that!11/30/22 11:20am PT:I've had car insurance for eight days now. No vehicle. No replacement contracts. Neda Ingham, VP of Orange Coast, sent me an email thanking me for my purchase. When I told her I hadn't been able to sign any paperwork due to \"glaring errors,\" he/she forwarded on my concerns to the appropriate people. CA law is the dealer MUST honor online price. Their paperwork does fall into fraud so I'm contacting a lawyer and other entities to help.

Turns out they didn't submit the paperwork until 5 days before that temp tag expired. The email I got said the paperwork was submitted to my local dmv so I called but they had no record of anything. I called Driveway to ask about this and time frames and they assured me this 3 week time frame delay was normal because they do a \"pre-audit\" whatever that is. And that the paperwork wasn't submitted to the local dmv but a third party processor. They could not say what the name of that processor is but that they are so great and have a 1-2 week turnaround time. I said that would be past the expiration date of the current temp tag and was told that is normal and driveway would pay for any ticket I got. Which didn't sound normal or good policy or a good enough solution but it seemed I was stuck so I foolishly just accepted it. Fast forward almost 2 weeks and I call again to get a status and that person says the communication says it was submitted to my dmv. I said I called my dmv again and they have no record and I was previously told it was sent to a third party processor. She said it might be that the dmv hasn't processed the submittal. Well I called my dmv again and they are at a next day turnaround so it's not that. She says she will email the customer care person and get back to me. I hear nothing so I call again the next day. This person was nicer and gave me her direct line and said she will try again and get back to me and that this super great third party processor has a 2-3 week time frame, which is just more inconsistent info.

I hear nothing and call again at the end of the day and she says that person must be on vacation so she'll ask a collegue. In summary we've had lots of back and forth over several days trying to get all the info out in the open.I'm now 9 days out from the temp tag expiration, over 2 weeks from when the paperwork was submitted...somewhere?? unknown third party processor?? No response, no solution. Everyone I talked to had some line about how great the third party processor is and it's so much faster than the dmv, but if they submitted to the dmv they would at least have a record and I could get a temp tag and be driving fully legally so it wouldn't matter how long it took, their canned lines just make no sense. They are a mess and what a terrible way to do business. Do not recommend and would never use again. If you do I would get the info about where this paperwork goes up front, including how they plan to deal with a temp tag extension, and request it goes to dmv and not this mysterious third party processor. Now I've searched online reviews and see this is common.Updated to add: The latest update is that the timeframe is Nov 10-17 which is later than the 1-2 weeks I was told during my first call on 10/21 and who knows how accurate that is and all of which means driving illegally or not driving at all for nearly a month after tags expired. They offered some compensation for taking Uber, etc or a week rental. I do appreciate this customer care person trying to find a resolution and none of this is on her but on the company's way of doing things. They know there are states where you can't get a temp tag and their customers will be in this position. But they don't say anything up front and don't give the option to send to the dmv instead of this third party processor. And the email I got even said the paperwork was sent to the dmv but it was not. That's the problem. Even their rental car solution would only cover one of three to four weeks and that's if the latest time frame is even accurate. So I'm happy to follow up with additional info but would note that I've been talking to customer care folks for 2 weeks already and I can appreciate that this is out of the hands of any individual customer support person but is company policy and way of doing business (I was told it's not a problem because driveway will pay for any tickets!) and it is why I would not use again and would recommend caution to anyone else without fully vetting how this registration process will work for you.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "They act as if they've never done ANYOFIT", "text": "It has been a nightmare, my partner and I had a total of 5 vehicle transaction and nobody seems to know nothing when asked as if they have never done this before.

In may I bought a car with them and had to wait until august for them to get title paperwork to my DMV for plates.  On top of that I wanted to trade this car for an EV; no big deal but they wanted it registered and to show up on the carfax report.  I had to harass driveway.com to get the paperwork in order to get plates.  Then I had to deal with carfax to update their database.  Finally I picked a car and started the process.  I still owed on my current car so I let them know of course but also that a 3rd party may be paying it off.  No biggie either they will pay it off first or cut me a check.  All the electronic paperwork was done and signed.  I then got the physical paperwork that couldn\u2019t be e-signed and started on that.  On a Monday, I was informed the trade was paid off so I let driveway know.  All they had to do is redo the paperwork to pay me and not the finance company for my trade.  My documents agent had to speak with her boss who called me and berated me over the phone, treating me like trash.  He then proceeded to cancel my purchase.  They then lost my outside funding for several days and I had to contact everyone and their mother to get my deposit refund and loan refund taken care of.  Driveway.com has been decent up to this point so after cooling off I tried again.  I had all the paperwork for my trade and a new loan and was ready to go.  I found a bolt EV with rebates up to 15900!  I was shocked but went for it as the rebates looked real.  The first problem popped up in the form of a recall.  My sales agent called the dealership and the car was on stop sale.  I know they can\u2019t sell recalled cars so I picked something else.  My agent then went to inform me that all Chevy EVs were on stop sale.  Odd because they had like 10 of them on the website.  I picked a Kona.  I live in a state with no sales tax but when the agent drew up the proposal she added 4000+ in sales tax.  We had a back and forth and I ended up calling the dealership where the car was coming from and confirmed that since the car was being delivered out of state, I wouldn\u2019t have to pay it.  I told her that and she fixed it.  By this time I actually called a driveway rep and informed them about everything.  They called the bolt dealership who found out they have the recalled part replacement and can sell me the vehicle.  I decided to go with that one instead.  I was then told that the rebates were expired (a lie) or not available to me for some reason (another lie). I started to choose other Chevrolet EVs and by the time we played the game of not available, sold, whatever, I was forced back into the Kona.  I like the Kona, it\u2019s just a bit more expensive.  Anyway I did the e-sign stuff and got the paperwork for this car.  I had it filled out when I was told my new documents agent will be gone for the next 3 days and once they process the paperwork, it should take a few more days to release the car.

Oddly enough that day I got a call locally saying my new car is ready for pickup.  I thought they were going to release it anyway so yay!  I get to the dealership and the temp plate/tag is missing.  So the local driveway rep called whoever and after I had already transferred my things to the new car, he hands me his phone and some guy states that because they don\u2019t have the paperwork I can\u2019t take the car.  He assures me that even though my documents rep is off for a bit, someone can deal with it.  So I\u2019m sitting here waiting for driveway to take care of their crap and give me my car.  Meanwhile they got their money as my bank just informed me the loan is processed.  My first 3 experiences were about a 3.5/5 but this whole almost 2 month ordeal drops it to a -5/5.

The Denzel said he was a salesman talking with his manager about the price of the vehicle and lowered it from 54 to 53000 and sent me a quote for my trade by the BMW website. Then I informed Mr. DENZEL/TRONG that i had a higher offer for my vehicle and that I would just take the other offer and buy the vehicle with the higher cash amount and I repeatedly asked for the walk out the door price of the vehicle. He said 53 but he Insisted I need to trade to them and I said no I can get 5000 to 6000 more with another person because my car is paid off and new with a factory warranty. Then he went on the say this car is not for sale now and it isn't even in the lot it is located in Vegas. He hated the idea I was going to buy the car right out and wanted me to finance and take their lowball offer. I said I get your in the business of making money but it seems your not in the business of selling cars?? I was extremely frustrated because I wanted to buy this vehicle. But be didn't want to deal with a cash payer he wanted me to finance with them as well. Then he took a left turn and sent all these crazy text saying thank you for considering driveway over and over.saying this deal is over.. I said I didnt consider driveway I was considering BMW and how he got involved I do not know. But he was communicating through different phone numbers and I believe he is one and the same person and continued to lie. I even called the BMW place and man said ignore them.and we can deal with you straight but then I got an immediate text from trong. But they are working with the same BMW website sending me text and emails. I will tell you what I think is up, they work you from driveway site and then when it dont go as they planned they end the deal. When you call the dealer straight out they make excuses and lie and say that isn't legit just come over here and we will take care of you and your deal is started all the way over until they get what they want. They find out through driveway, by using both sites, what your willing to pay or can you finance and make a deal if they are happy and your stuck with driveway but if they aren't happy they end the deal and the dealership steps in and this will start you over with their original price and now have the knowledge of your plans; such as financing, how much down, do you have a trade in and will you refuse their first offer? Are you a cash payer? . Do not use them people if ever driveway is involved hang up and call the dealer straight out or go to the lot. With your plan in mind and your price.

Let me start out by saying my initial purchase experience was pleasant and smooth. My issues began after the vehicle was delivered. When it was dropped off there were many cosmetic issues that were not noted on the website. The front bumper had a large crack in it, there were dings and scratches and to top it all off, the black trim and grill were painted with Plasti-Dip that was peeling off. The delivery driver informed me when he got there that the drivers side mirror was broken and needed replaced. I contacted Driveway about this issue and they rectified it right away, and that\u2019s where the pleasant experience ends. I waited 3 months for my plate and registration to be sent to me. I called and emailed numerous times to get an update on this and was ran around for 3 months, being told to call the dmv and the tag store to see if they had it. They didn\u2019t. FINALLY after driving around on a temporary plate that was expired for two solid months I got ahold of someone at the selling dealership. They gave me a run around for a week and then finally got my plate sent to me, after annoying them for a solid week. Now, my car did not arrive inspected, which was fine, I bought an as is car. I get it, and I wasn\u2019t expecting much. BUT what I was expecting was a car that was safe to drive and would run with little issues. I took it to get inspected after I FINALLY received my plate and registration. I couldn\u2019t even get the vehicle to pass my FIRST inspection, it needed 4 tires, brakes, a new passenger front axle (the fluid in it was leaking onto my brakes, which were cracked and falling apart) and both rear hubs are in need of replacement. My A/C line had been replaced twice and still broke and I have no A/C . My idler pulley has locked up more than once and has been replaced twice.The kicker? My PTU basically nuked itself, which is a common issue with this vehicle, since there is no way to service the transfer case/PTU fluid. So now my car is not running, well it turns on but barely moves as the inside of the PTU is like a bunch of loose metal flying around. The last I was able to drive the car it put itself into park, while I was driving it out itself into park. And now I\u2019m being told that because none of these issues were brought up in may when I brought up the mirror that Driveway is refusing to help me.  Plus I found a gps tracking device in my vehicle, Driveway admitted to putting it on my vehicle, and I was never notified it was there. I only found it when I was searching for a sound that was associated with one of the above issues. Oh and my sunroof doesn\u2019t work\u2026Do yourself a favor take a few hours and go to the dealership and actually LOOK at and drive the vehicle you like.

Exactly what I was about to purchase AND with a lower interest rate! Sounds great right? Initially things were going great! My sales rep called me and asked for some information. Once everything was reviewed and approved I sent my $500 deposit and waiting anxiously for the next steps......CRICKETS. Nobody contacted me regarding the next stage and as a very patient person I assumed that they were preparing paperwork and contracts, etc. Not the case! Another rep reached out to me informing me a proposal would be on its way. I received it and sent it back within the hour then.....CRICKETS! AGAIN, nothing! So again me being patient I waited and waited. I contacted the new rep shortly after asking when temp tags and title arrive before my vehicle is delivered. only to find out they don't operate that way! They retrieve the down payment and promissory note BEFORE the vehicle arrives then 2-6 week AFTER delivery paperwork is mailed out. Chicken before the egg?? Ok.....? I called and spoke with so many reps I'm dizzy and breathless. Because my vehicle was being shipped from CA the vehicle is not required to have temp tags and therefore, doesn't! So my concern with every rep is just this - you're asking me to agree to pay $30k for a vehicle I can't even drive for the first 2 months? On top of that the support staff had no clue what the solution was as they are integrating a new system. I got a lot of \"um\" \"maybe\" \"possibly\" \"I'm not sure\" \"I'll get back to you\" \"someone will be in contact\" ONLY ONE rep I spoke to actually spent longer than 2 minutes on the phone with me! Eli out of the TX branch - very helpful and pleasant! He needs a raise I would 100% hire him because the rest I spoke to were unhelpful to say the least. Tracking down information is a hassle!I got my first callback this evening and to my surprise it wasn't anyone that was aware of my situation THEY WERE CALLING TO RETRIEVE THE REST OF MY DOWN PAYMENT! What dealership operates this way? My gut feeling told me to send my contract to my attorney. Good thing I did! He said there were several red flags and this will turn out to be the worst financial decision I could ever make. He is still on retainer in case they decide to not honor the refundable $500 deposit as stated on their website and payment agreement. I urge you all DO YOUR RESEARCH! ASK QUESTIONS!

Today I spoke with Mike from Lithia Motors in CA who informed me that Driveways is having some growing pains and doesn\u2019t know the process in different states\u201d, he also stated that Lithia Motors has sent the Title to Driveway. Driveway tells me they are awaiting the title from Lithia. Another issue was a day after taking delivery of the vehicle the carrier company called me asking for a $2200 payment and said the delivery should have been COD??? I paid a $1200 delivery fee to Driveway directly. This was resolved but not until after several repeat phone calls, texts and emails falling upon deaf ears for a bit. Nick so graciously mailed me two $50 visa gift cards for my trouble. $100 for the BS that I have put up with from start to well almost finish as we are not exactly finished are we\u2026 I still don\u2019t have a title - $100 does t cover my wasted time, effort and aggravation. My advice to anyone looking to purchase a vehicle from Driveway is to RUN don\u2019t walk, DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!!! I\u2019ll keep you posted if when and if I ever get a title or response from Driveway. In the meantime I will warn anyone and everyone on every social media site and outlet to BEWARE of this company.My next step is small claims court, I\u2019m retired and have all the time in the world to do so!", "rating": 1}, {"title": "New Car Purchase but No Tags or Trade-In Payoff after 2 weeks", "text": "I recently purchased a brand new vehicle through Driveway, paid to have the vehicle shipped, picked it up on the 30th of July & dropped off my trade-in .

Paying back for a ticket you got is only one of the damages. Any additional hardships caused can also be claimed. Ask your attorney if you have questions about that.

Upon inspection the truck had a decent dent in the front driver side bumper. You could no see this in the pictures/video nor was it disclosed. The driver that delivered the truck took pictures and reported it to whoever. I am still waiting for someone to respond about this matter. I took the car for an inspection and there is some undercarriage rust that brought some concerns, but I know how to deal with that. Now for the big issue. I text the rep. that help set up the deal and explained that the temporary plate was going to expire in 4 days. The rep. text letting me know that she was going to escalate the issue and someone was going to call me. Two days later text the rep. again. The rep. reply with the same message: I will escalate and someone will call. No one call. Now, the temporary plate expired two days ago, and I cannot use my truck. I called the DMV and they informed me they have no record of the truck. Which means they haven\u2019t start the registration. Today (July 18, 2022), I made three phone calls. After waiting online until I was the next caller, I was sent directly to the voicemail. Of course I left them a nice message.But it gets better, the first payment is due in 9 days, and I don\u2019t have an account number for the loan. Maybe I don\u2019t have to make a payment until my registration is confirmed and I can drive the truck.Even more:Upon further examination of the sales contract, I found the following: I will like to know why my taxes on the vehicle are $2045.45. When the taxable amount in the contract states: $16257.00. The sales tax for the county where I reside is 6%. Based on this the sales tax amount should\u2019ve been: $975.42; that\u2019s a difference of $1070.03Even if you would\u2019ve used the NJ sales tax it\u2019s not going to add to $2045.45.Furthermore in the state of Georgia and New Jersey the value of your trade-in is not subject to sales tax.So, price of the vehicle $30931.00 plus $695.00 shipping fee equals $31626.00, minus Trade-In of $16168.00, equals $15458.00, plus $799.00 of other fees, equals $16257.00; the dollar amount taxes need to be pay for.If my math is correct, I need to be refunded $1070.03.Hopefully, I\u2019ll get an explanation on this issue, instead of having to \"escalate\" this with an attorney.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Awful customer service", "text": "Awful customer service, Do not do business with them.

I was contacted by Abdul and after a few texts back and forth he sent me the purchase agreement that would hold the vehicle for me.I immediately noticed the taxes section was incorrect as they were showing taxes based on the vehicles location in California instead of my home state. Between Abdul and Tom, the manager, they couldn't figure out the correct taxes so I called the actual dealer where the car was. After being assured that the taxes would be corrected on their end I signed the paperwork on 5/27/22 so we could get the process started...or so I thought.The deposit was paid immediately and I sent Abdul a copy of my license and insurance on 5/27/22. After going a few days without any word I contacted Abdul on 6/6/22 to get an update only to be absolutely ghosted. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and waited a few more days before emailing Tom and Abdul on 6/10/22 basically begging for an update. Tom responds fairly quickly and let's me know he still hasn't heard anything from the dealer on my contracts.After not hearing anything else back from Tom the dealer called me on 6/11/22 to let me know the contracts were currently being worked on and they would be sent to me ASAP. I took this opportunity to ask the sales manager a few questions on the condition of the vehicle. After asking about any dents, dings, or major scratches he assures me the car is in near perfect condition for its age. This got me pretty excited as this is the car I've wanted for a while now. I was able to get the paperwork turned around pretty quickly and had it back in their hands on 6/16/22.The best part about this whole deal was the delivery manager Carnell. He contacted me on 6/23/22 to let me know the car would be delivered on 6/28/22 and what I should expect during the delivery. When the car arrived on 6/28/22 the delivery driver and I went over it to make sure nothing happened during shipping. Being satisfied with what he saw he took a few photos and went on his way leaving me to go over my new car...this is where things fell apart...literally.I notice the front driver side fender is slightly misaligned and the bumper and headlight don't exactly line up like the passenger side...there is also a dent on the drivers side as well as a few scratches. The quality control side of me starts to kick in and I crawl under the drivers side front only to see more signs that something isn't right. I noticed there is a bolt missing in the fenderwell and an electrical connector dangling under the front bumper with the mount broken off. That's when it hits me that even though it had a clean carfax it had actually been in an accident at some point. This was confirmed when I discovered the double sided sticky tape holding the bumper on my $34k vehicle.I contacted Tom the very next day on 6/29/22 only to be, you guessed it, ignored. After waiting a few days, again, I contacted support@driveway_com on 7/2/22 only to be, you guessed it, ignored. So I said maybe if I contact customercare@driveway_com I'll get a response? Nope...I offered to work with them on getting the cars price in line with one that has had an accident but after being ignored I finally just told them to come get it. I'm not going to be stuck with a car that is already being sold above book value that has clearly been wrecked and repaired so I really didn't have a choice.

The reason why they are getting four stars instead of five is due to the delivery experience. We had to beg for updates on our delivery status constantly, and once the vehicle arrived it did not come with a temporary license plate so we could not legally drive it out anywhere. Also there was damage done to the car that was not reported to us prior when it arrived. Beyond that, Zariah who helped us in sales went above and beyond to make our experience enjoyable. It was the delivery team that let us down.EDIT: I still have yet to hear from anyone about getting my temporary plate or how to take my car in for the repairs to the bumper which I was told would be covered at no cost to me. I also have not been given any information on who my payments will be made to for my car. You are going from 4 to 3 stars, and I'll continue to remove stars until this is resolved.EDIT: Driveway reached out to me after I called customer service. Customer service informed me that the reason why I didn't get a temporary license plate is because, \"California doesn't play well with other states in terms of vehicle registration.\" I don't see how this is my problem, and I don't see why it would be acceptable for you to send me a vehicle that I cannot legally drive without a temporary plate. I was told it will be no big deal when I police officer pulls me over because I can just show him the documentation that states that this vehicle is indeed mine. The point is I shouldn't have to be worried about being pulled over.As far as the repairs go, I was told to take it to a facility in Phoenix to get an estimate. I was then told that the estimate would be sent over to higher upset driveway to be approved because this damage was not my fault nor was it disclosed to me before receiving the vehicle. It has been almost 24 hours and I have not heard whether or not these repairs are going to be approved so that way I can schedule this to be taken care of.EDIT: I did find the receive a temporary plate. All they needed was a copy of my driver's license and proof of insurance. If driveway had asked me for this before the vehicle was delivered (or had bothered to communicate with me in regards to when delivery would have been most convenient) I would have graciously provided it and then I could have had a temporary plate when my vehicle was delivered instead of having to wait almost a whole week. The repairs have still not been taken care of. I went to the Collision Center they asked me to go to (even though I had no plate so I was driving the car illegally to do this). I had them look at it and got the estimate. Driveway received it, but then informed me that it needs to be reworded and the service center has not gotten back to him yet. I also have not been informed about who my loan provider is or when my payment will be due or if driveway has communicated to my other vehicle's loan provider that the vehicle is in their possession.

B.S.  I transfer money all the time for my business, wire transfers within the States do not take 5-5 days to receive, international orders dont take that long!  So was lied to about that!  Never did get \"paperwork\" from anyone, had to ask several times about it and eventually received it in an e mail.  The delay to get the car from CA. to WA. was an issue and of course getting excuses about \"their shipping network\" was having a difficult time finding someone to haul it........   MORE EXCUSES!

Its a 2021 Challenger with 500 miles on it so there really shouldn't be much that needs done, but that's fine, if thats the process.  Well, the next issue is that the vehicle apparently has to be \"driven\" from the dealer in Seattle to my house instead of being delivered on a truck......  that was different than what I was told initially.  When the transport personnel showed up with the car, I could not be there so my better half took delivery, body wise the vehicle seemed to be in good shape, although pretty dirty, they didnt really discuss anything or go over anything with her, said the keys were in it and there was a packet on the seat and then left.  She said the entire delivery was about 5 minutes or less...... That seemed a little strange to me.  She pulls it into our shop at the house, went to roll the d/s window up and once up noticed a big tear in the window tinting on the driver's door glass, maybe that explains why the \"delivery people\" left the window down when delivered. I finally was able to inspect the vehicle when I got home around 10:00 PM on that Friday night and noticed the car was pretty dirty, the tear in the window tinting and damage to the front chin spoiler, which I was fearful of and had warned them about prior to transport, but my warnings were ignored!   These vehicles come from the factory with a very hard plastic protector on the chin spoiler for this EXACT reason, I was told that the Dodge dealer I purchased it from couldn't install one, they didn't do that type of stuff..... So, the next morning I contacted the main contact at the Seattle dealer to tell him that there was NO temporary license permit in the vehicle, the window tinting was damaged and the vehicle never got cleaned.  Of course, he doesn't know why they would have \"damaged\" the window tinting........  I needed to remind him that I had pictures that he sent me from his dealership, and there wasn't any damage to the window tinting in those pictures while at the dealer, the car gets driven to us and there is damage........  Seems pretty clear to me!  Then there is still this entire \"temporary license permit\" issue.  Still has not been resolved, was told I had to wait to talk to their DMV department, of course they are closed on the weekends, on Monday I call and was told that they would escalate this issue and I would hear back......

I\u2019ve bought a car, it takes no more than an hour once your down payment and credit is looking good. They do this for a living. Why has 3 days went past with no update on it? You can\u2019t keep telling me their finance team is working on the he numbers every day. That is just a lie. I can walk into a dealership right now and buy a new car in an hour.

He sent me a sheet of paper with generic monthly payments based on that car. I asked were these numbers set in stone and relative to my credit. The answer was no and that he\u2019s working with their finance to get the real numbers.

Secondly upon receiving my car the timing belt water pump oil pump and every component that has to do with the timing needed to be replaced took about 3 weeks for my car to get fixed Driveway got me a rental car. Thirdly now I am still waiting on my registration and license plates I bought the car on 11/27/2021 it is now 03/24/22 I have been pulled over 3 times and let go with a warning for not having inspection sticker and valid license plates???!!!?????

They told her they would handle getting the permanent plate and registration, as it customary with all dealerships. It is now 2 months later, and no tag. She can not get anyone at this company to call her back, and she has even tried the live-chat option. No one will respond to her. We called our local treasurer's office, they have not received any paperwork for registration, and the DMV did not receive a request for tags. She has been calling, leaving messages, and attempting live-chat for over a week with no response. This company is really good at selling a vehicle, but not so great with the follow-up.I received a reply from Driveway asking my daughter to please contact their customer care. She did that more than once, and we still haven't received anything from them. Absolutely zero assistance.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "BUYER BEWARE....I purchased a vehicle\u2026", "text": "BUYER BEWARE....I purchased a vehicle from Driveway 12/1/21. It was delivered on 12/18/21.  It took 55 days after delivery to receive my tag, 73 days from date of purchase.  This Nissan Rogue sat in my drive for nearly 2 months.  I could not drive without a tag and they refused to issue a Temporary Tag.  I even had the local Police come out to insure it was not stolen. No communication from Driveway, only emails from their associates without a phone number to return messages,", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Overall a horrible experience.", "text": "The buying process went smoothly. Unfortunately that's all that has. Upon receiving my car, I immediately noticed the hazard lights, radio, and 4 wheel drive button were non functiona as they were not wired in. The sunroof was also barely functional. While they were great with getting the appointment set up at a local dealership, repairs took about 6 weeks with no offers of compensation or a loaner vehicle, costing my hundreds in rental cars. My email to both Driveway and the dealership that had the car initially went ignored so far. I got the vehicle back today and it appears they left it unattended for those 6 weeks as the battery was dead and 2 tires were dangerously flat. The local dealership also charged me for their mistake and it took them a couple hours to get a tech to replace the battery. I also still have not received my permanent plates and registration in the mail and Driveway has not responded to my inquiries about those items. My car buying experience from Driveway has been a nightmare and it's still not over.Edit: 4/6/2022Driveway only refunded half my rental costs and one set of temp tags. When renewing them for a second time, I was informed the temp tags that were on the car when I got it (14 day tags) were only for commercial vehicles AND put under my name. I never heard back from the woman who contacted me about getting the send set of temp tags refunded or from the local dealership about finishing the last of the repairs. My car still has an air conditioning knob that doesn't function and hazard lights that wont stay on. Additionally, the driver side visor fell off in the middle of driving the vehicle and wont stat clipped in anymore and the passenger side visor is showing signs that it may not last too much longer either.  It appears Lithia/Driveway don't prioritize customer safety or selling vehicles that should work as intended. This is still a pretty disappointing update and saddens me this is how my first car buying experience has been. The saving grace is that the car seems to be just fine mechanically, but the car did come with more cosmetic damage than I would hope for without anything being disclosed. The photos turned out to just be stock images or intentionally hiding many noticeable scratches, dings, and a chunk of plastic missing on the rear quarter panel where the trunk closes.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "DO NOT PURCHASE A VEHICLE THROUGH\u2026", "text": "DO NOT PURCHASE A VEHICLE THROUGH DRIVEWAY unless you are prepared to wait, and wait, and wait. Initially, when we inquired about a truck, we had several helpers reaching out. Of course, customer service was impressive. The list of names reaching out for any little concern was long, that is until we pulled the trigger on the deal.  We were told 7-21 days for the full process from start to finish.  \u201cAll we need is your license and proof of insurance.\u201d  I can\u2019t tell you how many times we had to send the same paperwork. You are basically going to be sending them everything but the kitchen sink, 3-4 times. I\u2019m not sure if they lost the documents, or if they are that unorganized. They sure are quick to approve though, and accept that $500.  Once about 7-8 days rolled by, we reached out for assistance on the status. Not one person could (or would) confirm where we were in the process or our new cars ETA.  Upon calling, we received a \u201cone second let me put you on hold, I\u2019m not dealing with your case.\u201d Where did all those bright and colorful CSR\u2019s go now??After around the 2nd or 3rd round of documents and bank statements going months back were submitted, we then get a call from the \u201cdealership.\u201d Apparently these are not Driveways cars, they are only the middle man. Remember all the documents I mentioned, get ready, the dealership needs them as well. This is about 3 weeks in mind you, and AFTER receiving approval letter and deposit.  At Driveway, standard procedure includes accepting payment, issuing approvals, signing, etc\u2026 and THEN pinning down your vehicle, putting the dealership in touch with you all to repeat.  What if they had denied us?  What about the 2-3 week ETA we were already given?  What about the insurance you said I needed on day 1, I\u2019ve now been paying for for 22 days, but still.. no vehicle. Fortunately, after several unanswered calls and miles of paperwork, we receive a text from a non-mobile number \u201cyour vehicle is to be delivered Tuesday.\u201d Finally. The light at the end of the tunnel. Then, Tuesday rolls around, Wednesday, Thursday, no vehicle.  As it turns out, the vehicles check engine light- bright in all its glory, yielded a failed state inspection. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need a couple more days\u201d provided Driveway.  A failed inspection. Wonderful. This just adds to the list of what we are in for.We are now about 8 days past this failed inspection, and now we are told another week. \u201cThere are several recalls that need to be done.\u201d  Wait, which is it, recalls or engine light failed inspection?  Meanwhile, my husband receives a phone call, \u201cyes sir, it\u2019s just a bad coil, we\u2019ll have it ready in a couple days.\u201d  As we are waiting for the mystery problem to resolve, another text requesting- you guessed it\u2026 another round of pay stubs, bank statements, etc.  This is AFTER we have already paid a $1500 down payment, a $500 deposit, and auto insurance.  Where does it all come to an end, I don\u2019t know, couldn\u2019t tell ya. What I can advise is\u2026 do not buy from Driveway. FYI one person was helpful, her name is Amy. The only person who could answer one of our questions.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "This company will get you approved and\u2026", "text": "This company will get you approved and have you all excited about getting the vehicle have you to put insurance on it have you sign all the paperwork make arrangements to deliver the vehicle to you and just because you request that they deliver the vehicle to another address because you want to surprise your wife they tell you that they can\u2019t do that because the bank said it but I have never heard of such a thing and I sold cars for 20 years and never had a bank to say you couldn\u2019t deliver a vehicle to a certain address. So they will cancel your deal and tell you they don\u2019t need your business so I guess that\u2019s why they are not as popular as other online car sales like carvana vroom Carmax and the place where I bought my vehicle Shift which is a great place to do business with so never buy a car from Driveway they\u2019re crooksThanks for the reply I hope that you all can get things worked out where if a customer wants their vehicle delivered to a specific location they will be able to get it at that location especially if you are paying for the shipping cost you should be able to get it delivered where it\u2019s convenient for them and especially if it\u2019s only five minutes from your address this was really messed up because I wanted my wife to have the vehicle for her Birthday and Christmas so of course she was disappointed \ud83d\ude22 and so was I and there\u2019s no way to make that up to her but maybe in the future your company can try to accommodate your customer especially when it\u2019s a customer that lives out of town. I live in Mississippi and would\u2019ve been probably the first customer in the area with a vehicle from your company and it could\u2019ve opened the door for many more vehicles to be sold in the area because with the driveway plate on the front of the vehicle people would ask where is driveway I could have told them and by me selling cars to all the people in my town for twenty years they would trust what I say and definitely would\u2019ve bought from your company so with all that said hopefully we can do business in the future\u2026", "rating": 1}]

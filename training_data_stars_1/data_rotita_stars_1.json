The quality of the material wasn\u2019t great, but I expected that for the price (the sale price is a fair reflection of value, I\u2019d definitely say full price is absolutely not) and was happy to keep one. However, following return as per the company policy, I received an email stating that no refund would be issued due to stains and smell on the garments, and alleged photos attached to document the concerns. Actually, no photos were attached and the links were empty. Having immediately contacted the company to challenge the decision and ask for sight of the alleged stains, I had a second email response stating that there was \u2018dust\u2019 on the items making them unsaleable and in contravention of the returns policy. Again, no images attached and when I replied querying the difference in alleged faults and the lack of visual proof being provided, I was offered 50% of the costs reimbursed. As this was only about \u00a320 and frankly I had neither the time nor energy to keep emailing and pushing it, I accepted the refund and thought I\u2019d just treat this as a lesson learnt not to shop with Rotita again. However, the money was then credited to my account for use on future purchases, rather than refunded to my payment method. So, I had to write yet more emails, attaching the proof of the previous offer of a reimbursement and pointing out that based on my experience I wouldn\u2019t ever shop with them again so credit was no use at all.

THE QUALITY OF THEIR MERCHANDISE IS POOR AND SIZES DON'T JIVE WITH THE MEASUREMENTS.................................................................................................Where do I start? I placed an order on 7/2/24 for two swimsuits for a scheduled vacation. They never warn you it takes weeks to receive your items and that their business is not located in the USA. My estimated latest shipping date was 7/5 but the items were not shipped out until 7/10.  Eight days for processing a package for shipping is an extensive amount of time. I didn't receive the package until 7/16 which was too late. I had just left on vacation. When I returned, I contacted customer service and requested a refund. I sent the items back unworn in 100% new condition in their original packaging. Their policy is once their warehouse receives your package, they will have 7 days to review the items and issue a refund. I had to contact CS via email because I never received the refund.  I tracked my package and it was delivered on 8/2. I waited the 7 days and nothing.  CS said the warehouse needs more time to review the items and to be patient. Long story short...after numerous emails back and forth with CS, they tell me I received a store credit. I was livid and told them I never authorized a store credit and told them to credit my credit card which was the original form of payment. I finally received a refund, but it was not the same amount as the store credit. They charged me for using the return shipping label which is their policy. My biggest problem with this company is that they charged me $3.72 for shipping insurance (I had a coupon for free shipping) and my bank account was charged a separate international service assessment fee of $2.01. The total purchase price was $67.04. I received a refund of $52.33. I lost a total of $16.72. That is a lot of money to lose when making online clothing purchases.

However because the items seems very good value for money and just what I was looking for, I ordered 3 tops.  They took 3 weeks to arrive and due to the quality and size, I had to return them.  Again I found it very difficult to access their website to arrange a return.  This took several days to finally receive a response and a 'ticket' number, and I emailed them to ask for a returns label.  It was only then that I was informed I had to pay for the return myself.  I asked for a UK address, but they told me no UK address only an address in New Jersey USA.  I was dumbfounded.  Nothing that I was able to access on their website prior to my order informed me that returns had to be sent to America at my own cost.After several more weeks and Rotita originally denying receipt of my parcel, even though the tracking showed they had received it, I finally had a refund.Again, they did not tell me they would deduct money from my refund.  The goods were in the original packing, in perfect condition and unmarked, but they still deducted 6.00 from me.  That together with the 22.00 I had to pay to return the goods to America totalled 28.00 which they still owe me.I have emailed 5 times to ask to speak to their Chief Sales person, or Managing Director, or even a Manager and they just say I have had my refund and totally ignore anything else in my email.To return goods ordered online in the UK usually costs around 4.00 to 6.00 which I would gladly pay, if I knew I had to pay for the return.  But Rotita make it difficult for anyone to access their full website - only the order form therefore ensuring I did not have knowledge of the fact I had to pay for the returns.If you click on Terms and Conditions, Returns and Refunds or Live Chat, the screen just goes blank, then reload the page and the  same thing happens, unless, you wish to place an order that is !.

I have already provided this to Rotita more than TEN TIMES!! Why do you think I am still screaming for a refund?? I have also repeatedly reminded Rotita that I paid for shipping insurance, so that if anything went wrong with the packages, then I would get a refund or get the product replaced.

MY QUESTION IS WHY IS EVERYTHING SO DIFFICULT AND YOU ARE SO DISHONEST??TOTAL JOKE OF A COMPANY. Ordered items in early Jan. They advertise shipping within 3 - 4 days.

Now have to try to get money refunded by credit card.UPDATE It is now a week past the delivery date given. I have been in contact with this company and asked no less than 4 times for a refund and they refuse. Answers are totally illogical. Told they could not cancel the order because it had shipped and I had to wait for them to be missing before they would refund, how long I have to wait is not clear as far as I am  concerned they have not been delivered now.  Then I am told they have now shipped on 11th Feb so they didn't even leave China until well after the date for delivery and they could have cancelled this order because it hadn't shipped which was their argument in the first place FOR BEING UNABLE TO CANCEL IT. I would NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY . Very slippery business dealings they just want to take your money, VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. SHOCKING DOESNT EVEN COVER IT.FURTHER UPDATE This company has now said that the items have been posted  (ON 11TH) but will take another 3 weeks to get to me, I am to refuse delivery then wait another 3 weeks before they will refund.

I have never written a review, good or bad on any online company but this is my attempt to stop people from working with this company because of their poor service.I returned a really poor item/sweatshirt and followed the instructions which were not easy - I had to pay $8 to mail back (no free return label) and send copies of what they required, back in April 2019 and today, October 2019 i receive an email saying they received everything in good condition (6 months ago!)  But still no refund.  Their \"live chat\" doesn't even come back to you when you ask a question.  Apparently they do not give people a phone number for customer service.  I'm out the money, and the order, and have wasted too much time on this.  Don't take a chance, is my advice, even if the clothing looks tempting.  The shirt was big enough to cover a couch!  Exaggerating, but it was ridiculous, with sleeves way out of proportion, so of course I returned it!

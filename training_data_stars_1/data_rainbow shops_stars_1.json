This is my experience with rainbow shop. My suggestion is now I\u2019m not welcome back in the store because of a jealous woman home office is not gonna do anything because I\u2019ve tried contacting them , trust me you better off my application off at that store they are liars I just got off the phone with the district office. The lady from personnel told me if I go into the store that the police will be called on me for trespassing and I did nothing wrong. The manager tore my application up and shredded it the minute I walked out the office, the older lady that was chewing gum. Say you ain\u2019t got that shredded. I\u2019m a tear it up. She tore it up and put it in the garbage for me to be disrespected. Trying to find a job. It is unethical. I love long message with home office you need to be concerned about who you\u2019re hiring you need to be concerned about the crooked people that works for your company I am telling you vet people before you give your information I gave all of my information my social my birthday had I gave all of this gift for what happened they would have my information my tax identification number to do whatever it is they wanted to do this is why I wait till I\u2019m hired before I give them anything I\u2019m not as dumb as she thought I was ", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Make customers aware before purchase \u2026", "text": "The fact that you can\u2019t return SHADES with the tag still attached and a receipt is absurd.

I couldn\u2019t truly enjoy my shopping experience and  I couldn\u2019t figure out why . Not to mention he ( the manager Mr. James) didn\u2019t acknowledge me or other customers while they were entering the store. Granted , he was training someone.. but wouldn\u2019t you want to show exceptional customer service while you\u2019re training a new employee??!I begun to shake and feel super uncomfortable. Finally I asked the manager short , bald black guy and alittle heavy set was he the manager about a year ago. He shared that he was . He was very nonchalant and completely unprofessional. I  shared with him distressing experience at this location that directly involved him and impacted me .  I feel compelled to share due to my experience today . ( I hadn\u2019t been back in this location since the accident till today) While shopping, I unexpectedly passed out. My best friend asked the manager if we could use the restroom because I wasn\u2019t well. He hastily shared \u201c that\u2019s not my problem and we don\u2019t have a restroom , NO\u201d .  Then I passed out and hit my head on a shopping rounder . I later learned , today that he is the store manager and his name is Mr. James. My best friend and Sorors called the EMs, which is where I regained consciousness. From the information given to my support system from the EMs workers and the Police that was present with me at the store they said , the manager had absolutely no concern and no comment.  They were disappointed by his complete lack of respect and concern for his customers. Unfortunately, the manager's response was far from helpful then and today while I was sharing my concerns and my story. Instead of offering support or calling for medical assistance, the manager seemed indifferent to my situation. This lack of compassion and basic customer care was incredibly disappointing. In an emergency, one would expect the staff, especially the manager, to be trained and prepared to handle such situations with kindness and professionalism. Regrettably, that was not the case here. I urge the upper  management of Mr. James to reconsider their approach to customer safety and staff training to prevent such distressing incidents from happening to others. Today , as I politely reviewed my past experience with him he remained utterly un phased, completely nonchalant and rude as he shared \u201c Well your ok now \u2026 so what was I supposed to do ?? You had a people there helping you \u201c . Also when this incident occurred my brother Darin left a review that is also posted on this forum. This terrible experience and his lack of customer service and compassion helped me remember why I stopped going to this location. It swiftly reminded me why I drive to the shaker location. Although,  I was literally shaking and almost in tears while sharing my experience with him. He held tight to being completely unsympathetic and rude and exposed a continued a lack of empathy. I\u2019m proud that I was able to speak to him politely and with confidence. Praying that this doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else again. I hope that upper management recognizes the importance of safe, effective and responsible management. It\u2019s clear that this location lacks all of the above or atleast Mr. James does.

The manager as well as the customer service person dismissed me as stupid saying it\u2019s not their fault that I didn\u2019t know what card I used. I was only allowed credit or a gift card. The manager said she never heard of this happening before and asked other salespeople if they had ever heard of this-in front of other customers. I did an exchange. I called customer service again after I left the store to find out what might have happened that the numbers were different and I asked for a supervisor. I spoke with Dee who informed me that sometimes when online orders are done credit card companies use different numbers for payment instead of the actual credit card number. I called my credit card company and that is what happened. They used a virtual card number to protect my privacy but that number is connected to my actual credit card. That\u2019s why the card worked and the payment shows on my credit card statement. The manager at the Hawthorne Store as well as the customer service agent could have told me same thing.

Although from the moment we entered the store we were aggressively followed closely by a white female employee, who almost got between the racks and my niece, every time she was looking for items she liked, under the pretext of arranging the garments. Unfortunately my niece chose the Rainbow store at Franklin Square Plaza, in Bloomfield NJ, 07003, to make her winter clothing purchase, since she was interested in some items that were on the outside racks, when we were on our way to Marshalls. Unfortunately the store does not have dressing rooms, she could not try on, so she bought everything she wanted, to later return what did not fit. However, the return resulted in an aggressive attack from the same cashier with whom the purchase had been made, because he was asked to make the return in cash, he denied that the transaction was made in debit, even though it was paid with a Visa Debit card, he insisted that it was a Visa Credit card, although in the receipt says in Spanish Visa Debit. That is why I usually don't go into Rainbow stores, the clothes are poor quality, and the staff is always rude. Same cashier referred to us when my niece was paying as \"these two\", in a derogatory way, even though she was making a purchase of more than $100, to them, we still looked like thieves. I say that we got a discriminatory treatment, because I saw the cashier been polite to a young black woman who was making a transaction before us. He practically treated me as ignorant, arguing loudly and aggressively with arrogance that I didn't know the difference between Visa Credit and Debit.Not because I am Latina, certain age and speak some English, I don't know the difference, I make almost all my transactions with credit and debit cards like anybody else in this country. He stereopypes us and he chose to treat us with aggressive contempt.  He deserves a lawsuit. I asked him to print his name, he didn't want to do it, I told him that I was going to express my complaint about the terrible treatment that he had given us as well as again the employee who aggressively followed us through the entire store during this bad experience, I wanted my niece to return everything, but she wanted to keep the majority of the purchase.

Two days prior I bought a cute dress for $9.99. When I got home I removed the tag and tried the dress on assuming it fit me, but it didn't fit at all. Remember the dressing rooms are still closed due to covid so you can't try anything on in store. Two days later I planned on doing a big summer haul at Rainbow at that point I would also return the $9.99 dress. The cashier was immediately combative in not wanting to except my refund due to the tag being removed, but I pointed out to her that I had the tag with me it was just simply removed. She still being combative and condescending did not want to issue the refund. She said we can ask the manager to who her surprise agreed with me that I am due a refund. She said the tag being removed is a simple fix that they can easily put the tag back on. More importantly was the fact that I had the receipt and the dress was purchased just two days prior so they should issue my refund. I believe this bruised the young woman's ego as she was expecting the Manager to agree with her. This woman had a very very condescending attitude towards me even when she was speaking to the Manager I tried to explain how I had the tag with me and the young girl raised her hand up as if to say \"talk to the hand\" because she too was speaking with the Manager. So already her tone was extremely arrogant and condescending toward me.  Next I began my huge haul that took almost two hours of shopping. From picking out clothes to standing in the mirror along with other women having to literally put clothes over are own clothes to see if they would fit, since the store has not reopened the changing rooms. As you can imagine this was extremely frustrating. So after two hours of this I was finally finished and ready to cash out. The only cashier available was the woman I had trouble with earlier. She began ringing up all the items which was extremely time consuming because I had roughly $500 worth of clothing. I had dresses, shorts, pants, jewelry etc.. that took up most of the counter space. As she began to ring up one blouse in particular she noticed it did not have a tag. She asked if I could pick out another one that might have the tag on it. To my surprise none of them had a tag and I took a few to her to show her. She then asked if I got these blouses off of a rack because if they weren't tagged they probably weren't supposed to have been put up yet. I told her they were on the rack. She then said well \"If there is no tag I cannot sell it to you\" I really wanted the blouse it was one of the few items in my haul that really stood out to me. So I said can we ask the Manager we spoke to earlier if she can find out what the price is because I really want this. She calls the Manager over and starts being difficult again exclaiming how she can't sell it to me. Then I asked if she wouldn't mind seeing what the price is. The Manager walked over and also didn't see a tag so she picked out another top on the same rack, similar style and told her to ring it up for that price. To which the confrontational casher replied \" I don't want to do that\" At this point I am now furious what do you mean YOU don't want to do that? Your superior gave you an instruction you have to do it. So I got mad and told the woman \"Look you have been confrontational with me ever since I walked in here earlier to return the $9.99 dress. You are just looking for a reason to be combative towards me. So I tell you what since you don't want to ring me up, I don't want to spend the $500 I was planning on spending how about that. To which she replied \"fine, cool\" So I said you are going to let a blouse that is worth roughly $25 to stop the store from receiving $500 in revenue? She says \"that's just fine\" So to wrap this all up this woman allowed a $500 ticket to leave the store in the middle of a recession over a $25 blouse and her ego!

First of all they don\u2019t have any dressing rooms or mirrors in the store and when I tried on the Tshirt at home it didn\u2019t fit correctly. I brought the tshirt back on 5/24 around 11am and the manager whose badge read miss b dumped the bag on the counter a tag to a different tshirt fell out and she instantly told me oh you can\u2019t return this because the tag is not on the tshirt but she didn\u2019t look at the tshirt to see if there was a tag. She had a really nasty attitude. When I got home I pulled the tshirt out of the bag and I saw the tag on the tshirt and I discovered a loose tag in the bag. So on 5/25 I took the bag back to the store and I also wanted to purchase other items. When I Was ready to check out I gave her the bag and told her of the mistake that was made.She instantly started yelling at me and accusing me of bringing in a different tshirt that did not match the receipt. I was trying to explain to her what happened and she started yelling and over talking me. So I asked her to just ring up my other items and she said I don\u2019t have to ring up anything for you and you can get out of my store I don\u2019t have to do anything for you. I asked her why and I said I\u2019m a customer and you\u2019re refusing to ring up my items she said yes but gave me no explanation of why. I asked the young lady next to her could she do it and the manager told her not to and she agreed. I then asked for the corpora number and she said you can google it so I did. I explained  to them what happened and they said they would call the store. After the corporate lady called the store and talked to the manager she let the other cashier ring up my items, but now there is an investigation for me returning my shirt. The shirt does not fit and I don\u2019t want it. I\u2019m not trying to be difficult but my receipt and tag matches so I am entitled to a refund.

FedEx had a delivery date listed for 12/22/22 once they received the instructions from the shipper (rainbow) to send via USPS they did just that. FedEx has a responsibility as well, they held the package for 7 days instead of delivering it. The package went all over town before I received it. I placed a premium delivery order 12/28/22. Once again FedEx displayed a delivery date 1/1/23 I considered a holiday no delivery for a Sunday. Checked today my package is in a different part of town from where it's normally delivered from.

This was my first time placing an online order with Rainbow Shops. I placed the order to have some outfits to wear for the holidays, just to end up receiving only the tops, to the advertised outfits. Tricking the customers with deceptive advertisement is never good for business. You just lost a very valuable customer who shops at the local Rainbow stores on a regular basis. I do not want this order with only the tops of the outfits without the matching bottoms. I will never ever place another order from the online Rainbow shops ever again. It's been an extremely horrible and super disappointing first time experience.Respectfully,Marolyn Levon", "rating": 1}, {"title": "I never gotten my order I still waiting\u2026", "text": "I never gotten my order I still waiting for it to get to my house", "rating": 1}, {"title": "First let me say that I love shopping\u2026", "text": "First let me say that I love shopping with Rainbow, but my experience that time is the worst.

I walked in went straight to a rack that had leggings at it. There was a big yellow sign above the entire rack of leggings saying that they were on sale. I grabbed two pairs and the total should have came to about $12 with the sale. I've been shopping at rainbow for 10 years now. It's the same little sale signs they've always had. I stood at the register for 7 minutes with an associate unpacking boxes seeing me stand at the register and refuse to acknowledge me or get a cashier to the register. There was three employees total in the store so I don't really feel like there was a reason that I should have been standing there that long. I get to the register and the leggings ring up for almost double what they were supposed to be according to the sale sign. I brought it to the attention of the lady that was working at the cash register. She informed me that I got something that was not on sale. So I said okay that's fine. I walked back to the rack picked out two more pairs. They did not ring up through the correct price. My daughter needed them for school the following day as a requirement. The cashier never tried to make it right. They didn't remove the sale sign. Because my daughter needed them. I had to go to my vehicle to get some more money. This was about 30 minutes before close at this point. The lady had an attitude because she had to let me out the door because she had already locked it and let me back in.

I told them to just refund the money because they had the items. I told them this was too easy and they are doing nothing but ripping customers off. They give the runaround to keep peoples money.

Later, I was informed that I had to return the items back through mail to credit my account. So, I went back to the store to request a refund or either the items and the clerk said I couldn't have either and needed to talk to her stupid manager in Jacksonville by waiting 5 more days and returning to the store. I told her that was unreasonable and to get the manager on the phone because this is called theft of them keeping customers money.

Manager Needs to Learn & Adhere to Correct Return Policy Rather than Argue with Customers!", "text": "I'm disabled so getting out for me isn't always easy that's why I do 100% of my shopping online several times per week. Upon attempting to return online purchases at a Rainbow shop location the manager insisted that their store had a 7-day return policy should customer want cash payment and that my only option was in-store credit.  I told her that wasn't true, that it's a 30-day return policy and that I don't want cash but for my credit card to be refunded.  She refused, I left and the following day I called customer service.  Customer Service stated that the manager was incorrect and that she herself hates when the store employees give out wrong information and she apologized to me for the clerk/manager's actions.  Customer Service then instructed me to return to the store, explain the return policy to the manager and show the manager the back of my order slips that detailed their policy; also the representative instructed me to call Customer Service department back while in store should the manager continue to refuse to accept return under the correct policy.  So, I returned a couple of days later and instructed my son to record the interaction because I felt that the manager was going to give me a hard time and I knew that if I was being recorded as well that I would control responding negatively according to the manager's disrespectful attitude and behavior.  Needless to say, the same manager gave me the same response, I told her she was incorrect and showed her the return policy on the back of my order form and she still insisted that she was right, that she's been telling customers about the return policy there for a long time and that even on the back of their receipts printed out after purchases that the return policy states \"7-days\".  I said to her that just because the receipts states that, that doesn't mean it's correct information and that I'm going to call customer service so that she can hear/speak with them and she replied, \"Go ahead but it's not going to make a difference or change anything.\"I called customer service and as I explained the situation the manager leaves the counter as if she didn't want to hear what the representative had to say about the return policy.  The manager then reacts to my son recording the incident by saying: Oh, he's recording me!  He's recording me!  Who does that!I replied, \"Who gives out incorrect information?\"  She then tells my son to stop recording and we refused so she instructed another employee to call security on my son.  By this time several more employees surround the checkout counter, a few of which kept interjecting while the customer service rep on my speaker phone gave the store policy.  The manager continues to respond negatively to my son and he respond back to her that he wasn't doing anything wrong nor being disrespectful and that she was acting a little bit extra.  She then was told by another employee to go to the back and calm down.  Another older employee asked my son to walk away with them and I instructed my son to stay by my side.Another older employee whom stood by the counter beside me the entire time thought it was necessary to chastise our 20yr old son by telling him that he shouldn't have been disrespectful to the manager because she has sons too and that Black young men are getting into trouble , etc.  I ask how was he being disrespectful because he didn't curse nor call her names?  The lady contined to talk, not answering my question so I asked twice exactly what did he say that was disrespectful?   She never responded even when our son asked her the same question; instead she continued to chastise him.They still refused to acknowledge the customer service rep nor the policy on the back of my order form, telling me to come back a THIRD TIME when the District Manager would be available!  I refused whilst the customer service rep continued to explain over and over Rainbow's return policy.  Finally an employee called the District Manager, placed her on the speaker phone and the District Manager reiterated THREE times EXACTLY what the customer service rep and I both explained to them several times. Needless to say, another manager came from another store at the shopping complex and refunded my card accordingly.  There was this employee named Ashley whom were courteous to me the entire time we were there (about 20-25min).  Ashley apologized several times while the manager that was rude NEVER apologized nor acknowledged she was wrong about the return policy.  She was more concerned about the video being placed on social media and about being right rather than providing exceptional customer service.I've never experienced anything like this whenever I've made business or consumer transactions.

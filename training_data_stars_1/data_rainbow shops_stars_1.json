This is my experience with rainbow shop. My suggestion is now I\u2019m not welcome back in the store because of a jealous woman home office is not gonna do anything because I\u2019ve tried contacting them , trust me you better off my application off at that store they are liars I just got off the phone with the district office. The lady from personnel told me if I go into the store that the police will be called on me for trespassing and I did nothing wrong. The manager tore my application up and shredded it the minute I walked out the office, the older lady that was chewing gum. Say you ain\u2019t got that shredded. I\u2019m a tear it up. She tore it up and put it in the garbage for me to be disrespected. Trying to find a job. It is unethical. I love long message with home office you need to be concerned about who you\u2019re hiring you need to be concerned about the crooked people that works for your company I am telling you vet people before you give your information I gave all of my information my social my birthday had I gave all of this gift for what happened they would have my information my tax identification number to do whatever it is they wanted to do this is why I wait till I\u2019m hired before I give them anything I\u2019m not as dumb as she thought I was ", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Make customers aware before purchase \u2026", "text": "The fact that you can\u2019t return SHADES with the tag still attached and a receipt is absurd.

I couldn\u2019t truly enjoy my shopping experience and  I couldn\u2019t figure out why . Not to mention he ( the manager Mr. James) didn\u2019t acknowledge me or other customers while they were entering the store. Granted , he was training someone.. but wouldn\u2019t you want to show exceptional customer service while you\u2019re training a new employee??!I begun to shake and feel super uncomfortable. Finally I asked the manager short , bald black guy and alittle heavy set was he the manager about a year ago. He shared that he was . He was very nonchalant and completely unprofessional. I  shared with him distressing experience at this location that directly involved him and impacted me .  I feel compelled to share due to my experience today . ( I hadn\u2019t been back in this location since the accident till today) While shopping, I unexpectedly passed out. My best friend asked the manager if we could use the restroom because I wasn\u2019t well. He hastily shared \u201c that\u2019s not my problem and we don\u2019t have a restroom , NO\u201d .  Then I passed out and hit my head on a shopping rounder . I later learned , today that he is the store manager and his name is Mr. James. My best friend and Sorors called the EMs, which is where I regained consciousness. From the information given to my support system from the EMs workers and the Police that was present with me at the store they said , the manager had absolutely no concern and no comment.  They were disappointed by his complete lack of respect and concern for his customers. Unfortunately, the manager's response was far from helpful then and today while I was sharing my concerns and my story. Instead of offering support or calling for medical assistance, the manager seemed indifferent to my situation. This lack of compassion and basic customer care was incredibly disappointing. In an emergency, one would expect the staff, especially the manager, to be trained and prepared to handle such situations with kindness and professionalism. Regrettably, that was not the case here. I urge the upper  management of Mr. James to reconsider their approach to customer safety and staff training to prevent such distressing incidents from happening to others. Today , as I politely reviewed my past experience with him he remained utterly un phased, completely nonchalant and rude as he shared \u201c Well your ok now \u2026 so what was I supposed to do ?? You had a people there helping you \u201c . Also when this incident occurred my brother Darin left a review that is also posted on this forum. This terrible experience and his lack of customer service and compassion helped me remember why I stopped going to this location. It swiftly reminded me why I drive to the shaker location. Although,  I was literally shaking and almost in tears while sharing my experience with him. He held tight to being completely unsympathetic and rude and exposed a continued a lack of empathy. I\u2019m proud that I was able to speak to him politely and with confidence. Praying that this doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else again. I hope that upper management recognizes the importance of safe, effective and responsible management. It\u2019s clear that this location lacks all of the above or atleast Mr. James does.

The manager as well as the customer service person dismissed me as stupid saying it\u2019s not their fault that I didn\u2019t know what card I used. I was only allowed credit or a gift card. The manager said she never heard of this happening before and asked other salespeople if they had ever heard of this-in front of other customers. I did an exchange. I called customer service again after I left the store to find out what might have happened that the numbers were different and I asked for a supervisor. I spoke with Dee who informed me that sometimes when online orders are done credit card companies use different numbers for payment instead of the actual credit card number. I called my credit card company and that is what happened. They used a virtual card number to protect my privacy but that number is connected to my actual credit card. That\u2019s why the card worked and the payment shows on my credit card statement. The manager at the Hawthorne Store as well as the customer service agent could have told me same thing.

Although from the moment we entered the store we were aggressively followed closely by a white female employee, who almost got between the racks and my niece, every time she was looking for items she liked, under the pretext of arranging the garments. Unfortunately my niece chose the Rainbow store at Franklin Square Plaza, in Bloomfield NJ, 07003, to make her winter clothing purchase, since she was interested in some items that were on the outside racks, when we were on our way to Marshalls. Unfortunately the store does not have dressing rooms, she could not try on, so she bought everything she wanted, to later return what did not fit. However, the return resulted in an aggressive attack from the same cashier with whom the purchase had been made, because he was asked to make the return in cash, he denied that the transaction was made in debit, even though it was paid with a Visa Debit card, he insisted that it was a Visa Credit card, although in the receipt says in Spanish Visa Debit. That is why I usually don't go into Rainbow stores, the clothes are poor quality, and the staff is always rude. Same cashier referred to us when my niece was paying as \"these two\", in a derogatory way, even though she was making a purchase of more than $100, to them, we still looked like thieves. I say that we got a discriminatory treatment, because I saw the cashier been polite to a young black woman who was making a transaction before us. He practically treated me as ignorant, arguing loudly and aggressively with arrogance that I didn't know the difference between Visa Credit and Debit.Not because I am Latina, certain age and speak some English, I don't know the difference, I make almost all my transactions with credit and debit cards like anybody else in this country. He stereopypes us and he chose to treat us with aggressive contempt.  He deserves a lawsuit. I asked him to print his name, he didn't want to do it, I told him that I was going to express my complaint about the terrible treatment that he had given us as well as again the employee who aggressively followed us through the entire store during this bad experience, I wanted my niece to return everything, but she wanted to keep the majority of the purchase.

Two days prior I bought a cute dress for $9.99. When I got home I removed the tag and tried the dress on assuming it fit me, but it didn't fit at all. Remember the dressing rooms are still closed due to covid so you can't try anything on in store. Two days later I planned on doing a big summer haul at Rainbow at that point I would also return the $9.99 dress. The cashier was immediately combative in not wanting to except my refund due to the tag being removed, but I pointed out to her that I had the tag with me it was just simply removed. She still being combative and condescending did not want to issue the refund. She said we can ask the manager to who her surprise agreed with me that I am due a refund. She said the tag being removed is a simple fix that they can easily put the tag back on. More importantly was the fact that I had the receipt and the dress was purchased just two days prior so they should issue my refund. I believe this bruised the young woman's ego as she was expecting the Manager to agree with her. This woman had a very very condescending attitude towards me even when she was speaking to the Manager I tried to explain how I had the tag with me and the young girl raised her hand up as if to say \"talk to the hand\" because she too was speaking with the Manager. So already her tone was extremely arrogant and condescending toward me.  Next I began my huge haul that took almost two hours of shopping. From picking out clothes to standing in the mirror along with other women having to literally put clothes over are own clothes to see if they would fit, since the store has not reopened the changing rooms. As you can imagine this was extremely frustrating. So after two hours of this I was finally finished and ready to cash out. The only cashier available was the woman I had trouble with earlier. She began ringing up all the items which was extremely time consuming because I had roughly $500 worth of clothing. I had dresses, shorts, pants, jewelry etc.. that took up most of the counter space. As she began to ring up one blouse in particular she noticed it did not have a tag. She asked if I could pick out another one that might have the tag on it. To my surprise none of them had a tag and I took a few to her to show her. She then asked if I got these blouses off of a rack because if they weren't tagged they probably weren't supposed to have been put up yet. I told her they were on the rack. She then said well \"If there is no tag I cannot sell it to you\" I really wanted the blouse it was one of the few items in my haul that really stood out to me. So I said can we ask the Manager we spoke to earlier if she can find out what the price is because I really want this. She calls the Manager over and starts being difficult again exclaiming how she can't sell it to me. Then I asked if she wouldn't mind seeing what the price is. The Manager walked over and also didn't see a tag so she picked out another top on the same rack, similar style and told her to ring it up for that price. To which the confrontational casher replied \" I don't want to do that\" At this point I am now furious what do you mean YOU don't want to do that? Your superior gave you an instruction you have to do it. So I got mad and told the woman \"Look you have been confrontational with me ever since I walked in here earlier to return the $9.99 dress. You are just looking for a reason to be combative towards me. So I tell you what since you don't want to ring me up, I don't want to spend the $500 I was planning on spending how about that. To which she replied \"fine, cool\" So I said you are going to let a blouse that is worth roughly $25 to stop the store from receiving $500 in revenue? She says \"that's just fine\" So to wrap this all up this woman allowed a $500 ticket to leave the store in the middle of a recession over a $25 blouse and her ego!

First of all they don\u2019t have any dressing rooms or mirrors in the store and when I tried on the Tshirt at home it didn\u2019t fit correctly. I brought the tshirt back on 5/24 around 11am and the manager whose badge read miss b dumped the bag on the counter a tag to a different tshirt fell out and she instantly told me oh you can\u2019t return this because the tag is not on the tshirt but she didn\u2019t look at the tshirt to see if there was a tag. She had a really nasty attitude. When I got home I pulled the tshirt out of the bag and I saw the tag on the tshirt and I discovered a loose tag in the bag. So on 5/25 I took the bag back to the store and I also wanted to purchase other items. When I Was ready to check out I gave her the bag and told her of the mistake that was made.She instantly started yelling at me and accusing me of bringing in a different tshirt that did not match the receipt. I was trying to explain to her what happened and she started yelling and over talking me. So I asked her to just ring up my other items and she said I don\u2019t have to ring up anything for you and you can get out of my store I don\u2019t have to do anything for you. I asked her why and I said I\u2019m a customer and you\u2019re refusing to ring up my items she said yes but gave me no explanation of why. I asked the young lady next to her could she do it and the manager told her not to and she agreed. I then asked for the corpora number and she said you can google it so I did. I explained  to them what happened and they said they would call the store. After the corporate lady called the store and talked to the manager she let the other cashier ring up my items, but now there is an investigation for me returning my shirt. The shirt does not fit and I don\u2019t want it. I\u2019m not trying to be difficult but my receipt and tag matches so I am entitled to a refund.

FedEx had a delivery date listed for 12/22/22 once they received the instructions from the shipper (rainbow) to send via USPS they did just that. FedEx has a responsibility as well, they held the package for 7 days instead of delivering it. The package went all over town before I received it. I placed a premium delivery order 12/28/22. Once again FedEx displayed a delivery date 1/1/23 I considered a holiday no delivery for a Sunday. Checked today my package is in a different part of town from where it's normally delivered from.

This was my first time placing an online order with Rainbow Shops. I placed the order to have some outfits to wear for the holidays, just to end up receiving only the tops, to the advertised outfits. Tricking the customers with deceptive advertisement is never good for business. You just lost a very valuable customer who shops at the local Rainbow stores on a regular basis. I do not want this order with only the tops of the outfits without the matching bottoms. I will never ever place another order from the online Rainbow shops ever again. It's been an extremely horrible and super disappointing first time experience.Respectfully,Marolyn Levon", "rating": 1}, {"title": "I never gotten my order I still waiting\u2026", "text": "I never gotten my order I still waiting for it to get to my house", "rating": 1}, {"title": "First let me say that I love shopping\u2026", "text": "First let me say that I love shopping with Rainbow, but my experience that time is the worst.

I walked in went straight to a rack that had leggings at it. There was a big yellow sign above the entire rack of leggings saying that they were on sale. I grabbed two pairs and the total should have came to about $12 with the sale. I've been shopping at rainbow for 10 years now. It's the same little sale signs they've always had. I stood at the register for 7 minutes with an associate unpacking boxes seeing me stand at the register and refuse to acknowledge me or get a cashier to the register. There was three employees total in the store so I don't really feel like there was a reason that I should have been standing there that long. I get to the register and the leggings ring up for almost double what they were supposed to be according to the sale sign. I brought it to the attention of the lady that was working at the cash register. She informed me that I got something that was not on sale. So I said okay that's fine. I walked back to the rack picked out two more pairs. They did not ring up through the correct price. My daughter needed them for school the following day as a requirement. The cashier never tried to make it right. They didn't remove the sale sign. Because my daughter needed them. I had to go to my vehicle to get some more money. This was about 30 minutes before close at this point. The lady had an attitude because she had to let me out the door because she had already locked it and let me back in.

I told them to just refund the money because they had the items. I told them this was too easy and they are doing nothing but ripping customers off. They give the runaround to keep peoples money.

Later, I was informed that I had to return the items back through mail to credit my account. So, I went back to the store to request a refund or either the items and the clerk said I couldn't have either and needed to talk to her stupid manager in Jacksonville by waiting 5 more days and returning to the store. I told her that was unreasonable and to get the manager on the phone because this is called theft of them keeping customers money.

Manager Needs to Learn & Adhere to Correct Return Policy Rather than Argue with Customers!", "text": "I'm disabled so getting out for me isn't always easy that's why I do 100% of my shopping online several times per week. Upon attempting to return online purchases at a Rainbow shop location the manager insisted that their store had a 7-day return policy should customer want cash payment and that my only option was in-store credit.  I told her that wasn't true, that it's a 30-day return policy and that I don't want cash but for my credit card to be refunded.  She refused, I left and the following day I called customer service.  Customer Service stated that the manager was incorrect and that she herself hates when the store employees give out wrong information and she apologized to me for the clerk/manager's actions.  Customer Service then instructed me to return to the store, explain the return policy to the manager and show the manager the back of my order slips that detailed their policy; also the representative instructed me to call Customer Service department back while in store should the manager continue to refuse to accept return under the correct policy.  So, I returned a couple of days later and instructed my son to record the interaction because I felt that the manager was going to give me a hard time and I knew that if I was being recorded as well that I would control responding negatively according to the manager's disrespectful attitude and behavior.  Needless to say, the same manager gave me the same response, I told her she was incorrect and showed her the return policy on the back of my order form and she still insisted that she was right, that she's been telling customers about the return policy there for a long time and that even on the back of their receipts printed out after purchases that the return policy states \"7-days\".  I said to her that just because the receipts states that, that doesn't mean it's correct information and that I'm going to call customer service so that she can hear/speak with them and she replied, \"Go ahead but it's not going to make a difference or change anything.\"I called customer service and as I explained the situation the manager leaves the counter as if she didn't want to hear what the representative had to say about the return policy.  The manager then reacts to my son recording the incident by saying: Oh, he's recording me!  He's recording me!  Who does that!I replied, \"Who gives out incorrect information?\"  She then tells my son to stop recording and we refused so she instructed another employee to call security on my son.  By this time several more employees surround the checkout counter, a few of which kept interjecting while the customer service rep on my speaker phone gave the store policy.  The manager continues to respond negatively to my son and he respond back to her that he wasn't doing anything wrong nor being disrespectful and that she was acting a little bit extra.  She then was told by another employee to go to the back and calm down.  Another older employee asked my son to walk away with them and I instructed my son to stay by my side.Another older employee whom stood by the counter beside me the entire time thought it was necessary to chastise our 20yr old son by telling him that he shouldn't have been disrespectful to the manager because she has sons too and that Black young men are getting into trouble , etc.  I ask how was he being disrespectful because he didn't curse nor call her names?  The lady contined to talk, not answering my question so I asked twice exactly what did he say that was disrespectful?   She never responded even when our son asked her the same question; instead she continued to chastise him.They still refused to acknowledge the customer service rep nor the policy on the back of my order form, telling me to come back a THIRD TIME when the District Manager would be available!  I refused whilst the customer service rep continued to explain over and over Rainbow's return policy.  Finally an employee called the District Manager, placed her on the speaker phone and the District Manager reiterated THREE times EXACTLY what the customer service rep and I both explained to them several times. Needless to say, another manager came from another store at the shopping complex and refunded my card accordingly.  There was this employee named Ashley whom were courteous to me the entire time we were there (about 20-25min).  Ashley apologized several times while the manager that was rude NEVER apologized nor acknowledged she was wrong about the return policy.  She was more concerned about the video being placed on social media and about being right rather than providing exceptional customer service.I've never experienced anything like this whenever I've made business or consumer transactions.

Of course its our highly favorite until encounter an issue.Rainbow was my favorite to shop been shopping with them for years in store and then got a feel for online.However, do not want to be the burden I'm not satisfied with their customer service, in store service nor refund policy ( you have 30 days with an receipt).I worked in retail customer service for about 2 years and I know refunds can be issued between online and in store (just the way of doing things should not be the customer fault for malpractice error). How is it that they determine where an customer refund goes if it, reads back to original method of payment with an debit/credit that is linked?How you determine to give a customer store credit, first, it was error on their end sending two wrong items left me with 4 bottoms and no tops.Now lets make sense of it; when your making return within timeframe and conditions your coming in requesting for an refund and your excepting just that.Now the moment of hearing store credit your going to review your options to determine to agree with return in store or return it back via mail. I didn't get those options it was not giving to me store made discretion ; they processed my return told me would go back to original method payment been few days no refund in acct received as of yet thinking and trying to remember the company return policy checked it and for the method of payment dinged donged in my head store credit was issued and that is exactly what the store issued without my awareness of their online return policy no in store acknowledgement its not for customer to be in an situation remembering company's police as they have staff who is aware of it should always be implented to online returning customers especially when customers are within 30 days with receipt which is contract to refund vs without receipt issue store credit. This is a crisis.First attempted called customer service no assistance giving to fix refund issue then went back to the store was told all items already sold didn't believe that one moment and said; she told me it would be an store credit blah blah (not at all she said; that now its my word against hers and no way customer service should be that way in an federal trade).How people just take advantage of paying customers hard earned money and try to implent these return policy which I was in timeframe with and just forget about laws as well as if consumers has no right.Now under FTC which an refund should of been issued instead they illegally issued instead, an store credit in replace of it that could be looked at as FRAUD because this was not verbally agreed upon on return vs online return policy items were not purchased in store I had receipt I was giving in store purchase return without an receipt and that was not the proper cause.  Instead issuing an store credit instead of refund also, seems like money laundering as it didnt go back to it original method of payment; other options should of been weighed in to correctly getting me my refund back because that was my expectation under terms and coindtions.This is an taken of advantgae return policy tactic of refunding people reasoning got Fashion Nova with an court settlement with FTC.All I want is my $142.02 refunded not store credit not an option under any terms accepted without condition; even though policy reads it. I was not giving the option to decline verbally speaking with customer service over the phone nor at store in person.Poor customer service.I am an mother of two therefore, I know you know we know store credit is and would not have be an option to agree upon we would of sacrificed making that return via mail honestly.For brand use only: $sosom3Please refund to my cash app which is an payment method of an linked debit/credit card to my PayPal acct since your refusing to work with me issuing it back to orignial method of payment.Thank you", "rating": 1}, {"title": "I had to cancel my order immediately\u2026", "text": "I had to cancel my order immediately after purchasing it.

In this modern age what company does this. When you order from other companies you basically have hours to cancel your order if you need to.

Ephraim Ave Camden NJ 08104 location today to do a little shopping for Christmas. When I entered the store none of the employees greeted me or any of the customers that came in after me. It didn't really bother me much because this is the norm for almost all of the Rainbow stores I shop at. I was done picking out the items that wanted and I proceeded to go to the register to check out. There was one guest in front of me and two employees behind the counter. One of the employees was working the floor when I entered the store. When it was my turn to ring out, cashier operator number 0685AH started to ring up my items. She never greeted me, she seemed irritated about something. I let her know that I has took clothing off of one of the forms hanging on one of the rounders because it was the size I needed. She \"yeah OK.\" she kept ringing my item I asked her if a pair of the pants I was purchasing was a large as she was folding them and again she answered me very rudely, as if I was getting on her nerves for asking her questions. I had to ask her one last question, on which button is for credit too or bottom. She answered rudely again. I purchased a piece of jewelry and 3 outfits. She bagged all of my clothing and was going to enter my jewelry into the same bag and I told her can you give that me I will just put it in my purse because I didn't want it the clothing bag. She handed it to me, placed my receipt in the bag, and handed me my bag. I took my bag and proceeded to turn around and leave and she said \"Girl what is wrong with you? \" I said excuse me shocked because I didn't know who she was talking too, but I was the only one at the register. I said \"who are you talking to?\" she says, \"I'm talking to you, why you snatch your bag out of my hand? \" I said WHAT!?! \"I didn't snatch my bag out of your hand.\" She started yelling yes you did snatch it out of my hand so her and I is now yelling back and forth cussing and using profanity at each other. The whole time the manager and other employees are standing by watching her behave like a crazy person. The cleaning guys was the only one that ask me to please step out if the store because he seen how it kept escalating. We were literally about to fight each other over her thinking I snatched my bag out of her hand.Here's my problem. I am not sure what kind of training is being given to the employees of Rainbow Corporations, but rudeness, disrespect, talking on cell phones while assisting customers, having side bar conversations while ring up customers, not focusing on the customers, and a ton of ghetto horrible behavior being displayed by employees is a reaccuring issue. I have never had to write a complaint or an email because none of those situations had anything to do with me. This incident put the nail in the coffin. I spend a lot of money with this company and to be treated like my business means nothing at all because of the employees that are being staffed at the Rainbow facilities is extremely crazy. I will be going to a different Rainbow to return everything that I purchased. I will be pacing this on my YouTube Channel, and all of my social media outlets as Well as leave a review on your company page. I am extremely upset and this situation could have went a whole lot worse involving police officers, jail time, and court appearance.

Looked almost nothing like the pictures. Definitely not true to size. Ironically enough, I ordered 3 sweaters for a vacation and found 1 long sleeve black top that was only $4 on super clearance and I rolled the dice on at the last minute and added it to my cart figuring if I lost the $4, its NBD. That cheap top is the only thing that fit as it should and was good quality. So because they charged me $6.95 for shipping to return the other 3 sweaters, I basically paid close to $12 to keep the one cheap shirt. I'm still ok with that as it fits perfect, is super soft but it can't be worn in the cold weather where I am. All in all, I gave rainbow a shot but will not order from them again.Still waiting for my items to arrive so I can only review the selection in my size. Which was pretty good.

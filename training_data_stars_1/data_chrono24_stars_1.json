If you\u2019re looking for peace of mind with your purchase, I strongly advise reconsidering Chrono24. They left me out in the cold with no support after I lost a significant amount of money.Dear Mediation Team,Thank you for your response. However, I would like to emphasize an important detail regarding the delivery issue. The post office has confirmed that the package weight when it arrived in South Africa differed significantly from the weight recorded upon reaching the Steelport post office. This discrepancy strongly suggests that the item was tampered with or stolen during transit.This experience raises concerns about the safety and reliability of using Chrono24, as it indicates a potential gap in the security of the shipping process.

Based on my research, I knew I would have to pay around \u20ac1,400 in VAT (21%) and customs duties of a maximum of 80 cents in Spain. After the watch arrived at Madrid airport, DHL informed me that I had to pay a customs fee of \u20ac300, a handling fee for customs, and a tax registration fee of \u20ac300. I was refused any attempts to get more precise information on how DHL calculates customs (contrary to EU regulations) and to independently clear the goods through customs. I have arranged the return shipment. Due to this intransparent buying process, it was the first and last watch I bought on Chrono24. I would not have purchased it if someone had told me before I had to add another 600 Euros. I wonder why this is allowed; I have never had such an intransparent e-commerce experience. It's not recommended for me, at least for purchases outside the EU.UPDATE to the reply of Chrono24: You haven't addressed the point of my complaint. Maybe next time, you should read my post carefully rather than just copy-paste text blocks. It was not about the payment of taxes and customs. This is a no-brainer. The complaint about your company is that the buying process is entirely intransparent in terms of fees on top of the VAT and customs. You clearly stated that I have to pay 1400 Euros VAT (correct) and about 50 Euros customs (not correct; it should have been 0,80 Euros based on the European regulation). What you have not made transparent is that DHL charges 300 Euros to declare customs plus an additional incorrect 300 Euros for customs, which they wanted to charge on my credit card.

The seller first said if I were to do that it would revoke his 1-year warranty. He then went offline for a week due to a trip in China.

What if a person without much watch knowledge to have not detected the replaced hands and have not started questioning the whole authentication process?Chrono24 is definitely encouraging scam, fraudulent sellers and never on the buyer\u2019s side.

The dealer offered no credible reason why the two items would be shipped separately (and the only reason I became aware was after the items were shipped!).

It was sent from the UK to Australia using Royal Mail International tracked service. The full tracking details were entered into the C24 website and were visible to all parties including C24. The watch was delivered in 7 days, but the C24 website still showed the delivery status as \u201c awaiting delivery\u201d for a long time after the  actual delivery date. Therefore, my payment had not been released.I called the UK customer services number but ended up speaking to a totally disinterested customer  rep in Miami. She informed me that UK Royal Mail tracking does not automatically update on their website.   Hence, they won\u2019t release payment unless the buyer makes contact with them. He had remained unresponsive, so there was no progress. Although I requested  on the phone that the watch be updated to delivered status by her clicking on the courier link, she refused.  She just constantly stated they needed an email response from the buyer as proof of delivery & would not accept the Royal Mail tracking confirmation as proof of delivery. So there you have it, as a Seller you are at the total mercy of the buyer.  C24 will not accept the Courier tracking as proof of delivery. C24 are very keen on promotion & glitzy advertising, but do not seem to have invested the same amount of money in their employee training.In addition I also had to fill in a money laundering form twice before it was finally accepted  on behalf of Mango Pay their payment provider to verify my identity.Despite my watch being the lowest price example on C24, it still took over 2 months to sell. I know from previous experience it would only have taken 1 week on ebay.  So with hindsight it would have been easier to sell on ebay, despite their seemingly higher commission. However, Sellers be aware if you are selling to an overseas buyer.  C24 also manage to take some extra commission in addition to their declared transaction fee. This is derived from the terrible currency conversions they use when converting from the buyers native currency to your currency when the buyer make an offer. Although, the converted rate is shown before sales completion, you have no choice but to accept their conversion rate if you want the sale to go ahead.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Very shady company", "text": "Very shady company.

Fact: The watch was incorrectly advertised - After I had decided to purchase the watch I was made aware that the add had incorrect information. Non-trivial information like what material the watch was made of(!)- I was disappointed but decided to keep my interest Fact: The watch arrived in a much worse condition than anticipated - The watch didn\u2019t actually work. I took it to my local watch expert who inserted a new battery - The expert also made me aware of the other problems with the watch: The strap was extremely weak (it broke the day after and fell off my wrist), the alarm hand couldn\u2019t be adjusted consistently, the compass didn\u2019t actually work, some of the smaller dials (e.g., 24h) didn\u2019t work consistently- His conclusion was that it needed inside cleaning Fact: I wanted to use my 14 days return right but I was \u201cguaranteed satisfaction\u201d if I would only send back the watch for repair - I was sent many guarantees: \u201cDon\u2019t worry.

After so many tries to get a hold of her or someone, the New York office told me that they need a letter of power of attorney and the 2 IDs for pick up. So I did that and called the New York office and they confirmed everything is good now. The next day again same lady from Germany stopped the pick up because the 2 IDs were not on the same page, so I edit them and put both IDs on the same page. Then I hear back again that she wants the 2 IDs at the same place and the photo shouldn\u2019t be edited (at this point I\u2019m losing my mind, how can the 2 IDs be in the same place, if I was there next to him then I would\u2019ve just came and picked it up, this made no sense). Lastly I asked New York office if I can cancel the order and place a new one under my friends name so he can pick it up they said yes, then called me 30 minuets later and told me if we cancel the order then it takes 24 hours for the watch to become available for purchase again and by that time my friend would have been flying back to Canada.

This was a gift for my groom and 1st Rolex purchase. Had several time-consuming issues with customs, currency exchange rates, and form submissions that delayed the delivery of the watch, that finally arrived the week of my wedding. I contacted the Rolex Service Center, and was informed they do not offer authentication services. While picking up our wedding bands, I asked Jewler's opinion of the watch. He had a watch we thought to be the exact model, on hand. Immediately, he expressed doubt, and with my unexperienced eye, I easily recognized the difference in these characteristics (weight, size of case, Warranty Card Font). Located in a building with many other Jewlers, he asked others to come over to take a look. Each questioned the same features.  With less than 4 days until my wedding I learn this relatively pricey gift intended for my groom, may or may not be genuine.  Immediately, I contacted C24 and as instructed, got the Seller's permission to have the watch opened. Abiding by the protection policy detailed on the website, I circled back to C24 for written permission to open the watch. Over the event filled week of my wedding, the seller sent several lengthy messages, pressing me to have the watch opened. I indicated each time that I needed C24 to provide the written permission so I could retain my protection as the buyer.  As our out- of-town guest arrived and planned events started,  I found myself being hounded and needing to respond to more than 25 emails. Time intended for final touches and preparation for my wedding, which I spent nearly 2 years planning,  was wasted on this fiasco. Those precious days were consumed with research, phone calls, opinion comparison, protection confirmation, reviewing and responding to an absorbent number of emails, locating back-up gifts, securing additional funds for alternative watches, and worst of all, worrying about this watch.   Never once did Seller or C24 offer any assistance or verifiable reassurance towards the authentication. Finally, 2 days after the wedding, C24 provided written permission, instructing me to take the watch to Rolex. Again, as they had just one week prior, Rolex stated they do not authenticate watches. After explaining the the nightmare transaction, Rolex opened the watch, and explained that two models of this particular Datejust were produced in 2016.

In Jan 2022 I purchased a 2005 Rolex Explorer II 16570 Polar dial from Scandinavian Luxury AB t/a The Vintage Watch Agency (the Seller). In short, I had to hire a Lawyer in Stockholm to demand restitution for misrepresenting and selling a fake watch. It's a long story that cost me almost two thousand dollars, but for those of you interested - please read on.After a few days I noticed the watch was not keeping good time and the seller had apparently listed the wrong 3186 calibre instead of the older 3185 Calibre. The seller agreed for me to return the watch, but It had to be returned from within Europe to avoid customs duties. I was already in the States. Time passed beyond the date I had hoped to return to Europe so in September 2022 I decided to accept the watch with the older Calibre and have it serviced by Rolex RSC in Dallas. In Nov 2022 Rolex informed me the Watch was not eligible for Service. They said the Serial Number was Altered. (photo below)I informed Chrono24 and the Dealer.  The Dealer, after Speaking to RSC Dallas and at C24's suggestion, instructed me to return the watch so that it could be sent to Rolex HQ in Geneva, Switzerland. \"Txxo\" at Chrono24 told me that Rolex Europe operated differently than Rolex USA. ( Hard to believe, but whatever..) I travelled back to Europe and returned the Watch to the seller in Dec 2022. Time passed and I had no news. In Feb 2023 The seller informed me that the Local AD Bergstr\u00f6ms was willing to service the Watch. I refused, Local AD's are independently operated and do not always adhere to the same standards and procedures of Official RSC's. Evidently the AD \"Bergstr\u00f6ms\" failed to notice the Altered serial number or was willing to overlook it. I insisted that Rolex carry out the service as agreed (which I was going to pay for). Eventually the seller claimed to have sent it to RSC Geneva, and told me it could take 3 months. June 2023, Still no news, I asked the seller to provide proof or a receipt that they sent the watch to Rolex or refund me. They refused, and told me to wait longer. I called Rolex to see if they had my watch, but they could not confirm this. I sent a demand Letter to the Vintage Watch Agency for a refund, which they ignored. I reached out to Chrono24, and they replied stating it's not their problem and that they were no longer mediating this issue. I initiated an ECC and ODR out of court claim, that the seller also Ignored. So in Sept 2023 I had to hire a lawyer in Stockholm, who looked at my claim and agreed to bring a lawsuit against the seller. The seller responded saying they would refund me the cost of the watch, less $1,000 dollars for \"servicing and handling\". Emotion and rational thinking are incompatible, as was the cost to pay my Lawyer to argue the settlement. I reluctantly accepted their disgusting offer and cut my losses. Once I  got my money I was asked to leave feedback on the Chrono24 site. Well, I tried to leave a five sentence summary of my wonderful experience, but C24 rejected my reviews twice. They Told me that the Seller has to approve my review in this case.In conclusion, don't buy from Chrono24.They claim that every watch sold is Guaranteed Authentic.

Having spent months looking for a watch I finally went ahead to buy one. The first problem was having agreed to buy the watch Chrono send you their escrow account details to pay into.Only they give you the wrong account name. They tell you to pay it to an account under the name 'Chrono24 GmbH'. The bank immediately flagged this up as potential fraud given the account is actually listed under a third party company called 'mangopay' who Chrono24 use for their escrow account.So I had my transaction blocked by the bank (and almost my account) as the name and account details Chrono gave me did not match. It took 3 calls to Chrono24 to figure out what was happening when finally the customer service agent admitted it and said 'it happens all the time, you need to send it through under the name 'mangopay' not chrono.I thought this was the end of my issues...wrong! Next Chrono24 ask me to send extra verification. Which now required me to upload personal documents and a video of myself to a third party company called IDNOW. A company which have a trustpilot rating of 2.8. When I called up to query this, because you know, identity theft and cybersecurity are a thing...Chrono customer services were hopless.One agent said I would be contacted back, didn't happen. The next said she would email me details. Didn't happen. The final one actually became very aggressive on the phone because I had the audacity to care about cybersecurity and then ask for information about when I would be seeing my own money again. Spoken over. Spoken down too. All I asked was to verify directly with Chrono and not some dodgy third party with 2.8 on trustpilot.As it stands, Chrono have taken 16k from me and put it in one of their third party accounts. Almost got me blocked out of my own bank account through their obfuscation and wasted countless hours. Then sent me around their customer 'service' hellscape in which nobody is on the same page nor does anything they tell you they will do. Then you get the belittling Marcel who loses his temper because you're not wanting to send your passport and a video of yourself to a dodgy third party outfit online. So right now, I am completely stuck and awaiting the mythical email they keep promising you.What a joke.

Just a person on a phone to tick the box...but you're alone here. Will I ever see my money again? I am sure they'll respond below...'we will forward this to our customer service'. Which is basically the shredder so far as I can tell. This is all wrong. How can they get away with this when there is so much money involved?! Next port of call unfortunately looks like it will be me putting in a fraud case with my own bank against the payment to try and it back. A nightmare.UPDATE: Within 1 hour of this review being published Chrono24 cancelled my account due to 'security reasons'. This is the kind of company we are dealing with here.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "More prompt responses to issues.", "text": "More prompt responses to issues.It's like I will do it when I get to it kind of working style.

As a customer that relied on your assurances of a safe transaction, authentic watches, and reliable dealers, I am deeply dissatisfied with the outcome, which failed to meet these commitments.I recently purchased a vintage Breitling watch from Pasini Gioielli, which was explicitly advertised as being in perfect condition and featuring an automatic mechanism. However, upon receiving the watch, I quickly noticed several issues directly contradicting the seller's claims. Firstly, the watch was a mechanical timepiece instead of the advertised automatic one. The watch didn\u2019t work and needed service. Additionally, the small hands had been replaced with non-original Breitling hands.I contacted Chronos 24 to report the problems and suggested a possible solution. I proposed that I would be willing to keep the watch if the seller agreed to refund the servicing costs and cover the expenses associated with restoring the original hands.Regrettably, neither Chronos 24 nor Pasini Gioielli accepted any responsibility for the situation, nor did they demonstrate any willingness to rectify the matter.  In fact, the only resolution offered to me was to return the watch at my own expense. This proposal is deeply troubling, due to the return policies outlined, which state that the seller may withhold the refund if they deem the watch to be in anything other than its original condition. Considering the unreliability and lack of transparency displayed by the seller thus far, assuming such a risk is simply untenable.  Ultimately, I didn\u2019t return it and accepted $65 that the Chronos 24 paid for the small hands.In summary, it is clear that Chronos 24 has failed to provide the support and assistance expected from a trusted platform. Furthermore, Pasini Gioielli's conduct has been highly unprofessional and unreliability as a dealer.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Many fake listings and the site\u2026", "text": "Many fake listings and the site supports them.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "The seller never gave me the paperwork.", "text": "Date of experience: November 15, 2023", "rating": 1}, {"title": "The seller did not fulfill his promise\u2026", "text": "The seller did not fulfill his promise sending me the additional accessories.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "I couldn't get an answer regarding\u2026", "text": "I couldn't get an answer regarding tariff.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "My small and simple question still not\u2026", "text": "My small and simple question still not solved", "rating": 1}, {"title": "The promised wrist extension has never\u2026", "text": "The promised wrist extension has never arrived, constant excuses.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Poor", "text": "Poor, can\u2019t cancel ", "rating": 1}, {"title": "annoying app", "text": "Don\u2019t want to race a review", "rating": 1}, {"title": "i did not sold the watch,don't send any\u2026", "text": "i did not sold the watch,don't send any email to me", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Got scammed and could not get my money\u2026", "text": "Got scammed and could not get my money back!", "rating": 1}, {"title": "I was told that I could return the watch if I was not happy with it before 14 days.

However he still requested a \"certificate of authenticity\" which is something I can't provide. you may also please audit the email he sent to me it was so unprofessional. if the goal is to proof the watch authenticity the service quote from the manufacturer would suffice to proof this as per the watch manufacturer. However, communicating with alen doesn't lead to anywhere. alen failed to listen and exercise logic in his response.     Furthermore, I requested for my inquiry to be escalated to the manager but he wouldn't listen. alen mentioned that he is the most capable individual in the chrono24 and in charge.Would you be able to assist me with my issue as a mediator and review my case or escalate this matter with a manager at chrono24.

After 2 weeks, it was clear there was an issue with the transfer and again requested Chrono24 to advise for a solution. They replied advising for my patience until the transfer is refunded back to them before they can initiate once again.My bank was able to trace the payment using the swift copy and they found out the payment has been rejected by the intermediary banks due to C24\u2019s payment service provider not providing a purpose for the payment transfer.After 64 days, they confirmed the transfer has been refunded and they are preparing to initiate a second transfer attempt, I asked for an alternative payment however they refused, and initiated the transfer a week later.A week after the second transfer attempt, and upon not receiving the payout amount to my account, I contacted them to enquire why i have not received the amount and requested them intervene. long story short, the transfer failed - as per the bank the reason is not providing cover funds within the time frame.Upon not receiving any feed back or any satisfactory customer service, I decided to email the senior management at both Chrono24 & MangoPay (Their payment service provider). With the hope and expectation that they would clean this mess and offer a resolution. Besides apologizing for the inconvenience, they offered zero support and the circus show went on.After 100 days of waiting for my payout, i called their customer service and was able to speak to directly with department head, who promised once the second transfer was refunded back to them and understanding the reason of the transfer failure, C24 will discuss with me an alternative payout solution.The above did not happen as on Day 108, I received an email from Chrono24/Mango Pay that they have located the transfer funds in a bank in the US and have already green lighted the bank to proceed with immediate effect. Obviously leaving me furious.A week after the above and not receiving the funds, I contacted Chrono24 and was informed by them to deal and sort it out with MangoPay.Well folks, today is day 139, and after more than 100 emails and over 30 international phone calls with Chrono24, who i must say are absolutely useless, I am yet to receive my payout from Chrono24.Note that I have successfully sold 5 watches previously on the platform with no change to my bank account details, which is stored with them.So to briefly conclude,As the payment processor is an integral part of C24 business model. C24 have facilitated, managed and taken money (fees) for this transaction therefore they're responsible for fixing any issues along the way. They're currently showing that they don't care about their customers and are unwilling to assist in fixing problems that occur when using their service.

The watch was running 10 hours slow per day. I repeat that. 10 hour slow per day. When I reached out to the seller they ignored me and passed me off to Chrono24 \u201cmediation\u201d team.

This is a big deal on a blancpain watch - as it only has a two year warranty. I effectively lost 1/6 of the warranty value straight out of the box.

If you are a professional watch dealer, you wont imagine how this platform allows a customer to ruin a watch you want to sell, as well as your profile. As a buyer, If you want to scam a seller, buy a watch and use it as you want for 2 weeks and then return it for no reason, chrono24 is just right platform for you. In addition, you can easily steal the watch by claiming that there is no watch in the box, even though you have purchased an expensive watch and received the product. You can also claim your watch hasn't arrived during the pandemic as DHL or other couriers was not provide proof of delivery. This platform just right platform to lose your watch and your money.Unfortunately, an unworn watch we sold on this platform, a malicious customer wanted to return it after 10 days without giving any reason, I could not explain my problem to the UK representative of chrono24, she is very rude and far from what she does, you will be deceived by the customer, lose money, even she doesn't care if your account is destroyed, she is just trying her best to make herself available to higher authorities.As a customer, If you have a special day, if you are going to a wedding, go to chrono24 and get a watch you like, after 10 days return the watch without giving any reason and get all your money back, then complain to chrono24 that the seller complained about you.Being a platform away from the safe selling of watches, chrono24 will allow you to return the watch in very bad condition since it was first sold, leave a bad review, and even allow the customer representative to be rude to the seller.In order not to be a victim anymore, I stopped selling on this platform, I closed my account. Now everything is stress free, trust me you will make better business if you stop selling on chrono24.I am ready to prove my bad experience from the beginning to the end, I recommend ebay to professional sellers, they provide both authenticity check and you get your money without any problems.

The watch was described as 100% authentic, hardly used and I got it at a standard price. Nothing to worry about I thought. The seller was Chrono-Arena from Germany \u2013 and of course approved by Chrono24.Fast forward to now. I go to a Rolex / Tudor AD to get it serviced because the dial fell got loose. However, the AD repair shop does not want to touch it as it has unoriginal parts. I now have a watch that I can't use, sell or get serviced. I try to contact the seller, Chrono-Arena. No reply. Chrono24 sends them a couple of messages to contact me but that's it. No reply. And no further help from Chrono24. Basically, there is NO Buyer Protection as Chrono24 claim. As a buyer you have no security on Chrono24 \u2013 as it seems scammers can unload their unoriginal watches on Chrono24 with Chrono24 vouching for them.Eg. Chrono24.com states: 'In the rare instance that the watch is counterfeit, you will receive your money back.'... don't believe them. You're on your own. They will NOT reimburse you.If you're in the market for a Rolex, AP, Tudor, Omega, Panerai etc. Chrono24.com is the last platform you should use.

I was really happy with my purchase at first: because of the price that is a little below retail and also because of the watch itself that is beautifully made by Seiko.Little did I know why the price of this watch was so low:Ten days ago, after a month and a half of careful use (not wearing it everyday, no shocks whatsoever...), I discovered that the watch's crown was defective: manuwind isn't working anymore, it stays on position 1 (the date changing position, which can actually damage the movement) and the crown can actually be fully unscrewed: I had it detached from the watch...So I rushed to the Seiko official boutique in Paris to repair it. They told me it was defective from the start and that no seller should have been offering me a product with those QC issues.My watch wont be available for at least one month and Seiko can't really tell the amount of damage done on the movement due to this malfunction ... I thanked Seiko for their professionalism: They are the nice guys in this story and I will make sure to buy from them directly in the future.I find it infuriating that dishonest (to say the least) \"certified dealers\" use a remarkable brand such as Seiko, to do shady business selling defective watches at supposed \"attractive price\".I will be calling Chrono24 next week about this incident, because my comments concerning Watch Kingdom cannot be updated. and I don't want any other honest buyer like me falling into one of their scams.Regards,Maxime Hurtault", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Unfriendly customer service that left me shaking!", "text": "I've recently become a frequent seller of watches on Chrono24, and following my latest sale discovered that Chrono24 charges a 2.5% fee in exchange rate fees when exchanging between euros and pounds.Although based in the UK, I have a euro bank account, so I decided to call customer service to see if I could register my euro bank account and receive the payment in there, thus avoiding the 2.5% fee.I was told by the representative that this wasn't possible, so I asked if this is a feature they might consider building. This seems like a no brainer to me, since it wouldn't result in Chrono24 losing any commission, but would represent a win for the buyer and seller, since this wouldn't need to be priced into the price. At this point the call started to feel very unfriendly, and not one but two representatives, started talking to me in deeply unpleasant and aggressive tones that left me physically shaking. It was clear that they were saying whatever they needed to to get me off the phone as quickly as possible with no intention of following up.Chrono24, please consider building this feature! You've got a great product and I'd love to consider you as an option in the future. 3 of my last 5 sales would have benefited from this feature, but without it your fees and commissions total 8.5% rather than 6.5%.

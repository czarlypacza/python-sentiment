The first realtor wanted to set the asking price significantly below the market value.  I hired the second realtor as he appeared to understand the market and had some good ideas on how to market my house. In the end, I don't believe that he had my best interests in mind and did not represent me well in the negotiation process with the buyers realtor. He set the intial asking price too low and during the negotiation process with the buyers realtor he encouraged me to continue to accept a lower offer and to give additonal credits to the buyer. I believe his primary object was to just get the house sold as soon as possible regardless of how much it costs me in a lower price. In the end I believe I sold my house at below market value. Also, during the initial open house he showed up only minutes before when there were potential buyers waiting in their cars. He also convinced us that the 4th quarter of the year was a good time to list a house and that was not our experience as we did not have but one offer. Also, through out the process he would say one thing and then later say exactly the opposite and we concluded that we could not rely on him to provide us with accurate information. I would highly recommend that you use a different company other than Clever as I believe that the lower commission fee resulted in a lower quality realtor.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "They treat their referral agents very\u2026", "text": "They treat their referral agents very badly, realtors beware :( you can easily find a local agent who will offer you the same rate clever does. The owner harassed and threatened me in 2020, the morning I was going into surgery over a $900 check I had sent them twice already that they had lost or misfiled. Their response to this review is pretty typical, trying to shift blame back to the agents they're basically exploiting.

I current own 6 properties and do a fair amount of buying-flipping, etc.,  so I am somewhat familiar with the real estate world.  This realtor was rude and unprofessional from day one. He immediately wanted to lower the price of my house, even though it was priced very competitively with the other properties currently listed in our neighborhood. He has had our listing since January and only shown it twice in 6 months. He also refused to let me out of the contract even after repeated requests from me stating that I did not want to sell it at this time and that I was extremely unpleased with his service. The only thing he would agree to do is remove it from the MLS but informed me the contract would remain in full force. I have never asked any realtor to end a contract and never encountered a realtor who was not in contact with you. Mr. Brown never contacted me with any updates unless I reached out to him and then it was several days and sometimes took me reading out a second time to him to get any response. I tried Clever hoping to save money, now I have wasted 6 months,mortgage payments and no results. I will gladly pay the full real estate commission moving forward. I would give no stars for this realtor if it were possible. Lesson learned, you definitely get what you pay for!", "rating": 1}, {"title": "bad experience", "text": "Our realtor was Chris Doss with Clever.  It was clear from the start that he wanted to devote the minimum amount of time to our listing. We rewrote the MLS paragraph ourselves after reading Chris\u2019 effortless write-up. He put a lot of pressure on us to list below what we knew our house was worth. Initially, $15,000 lower, and then as much as $35,000 lower at times when showings were slow. He told us repeatedly that our house wasn\u2019t worth what we wanted, and even if we got an offer for that amount, it would never appraise for that amount. (We did get exactly that amount because we stubbornly held out for it, and it did appraise for that amount. We were under contract in 30 days.) Chris was extremely pushy and direct about us taking the first offer that came in when we weren\u2019t comfortable with it. He also never emailed us offers until we specifically asked him to do so so that we could look them over. He always made us feel as if this was asking a lot on our part. Some offers we never even saw, only heard of through him over the phone. We would later find out that offers conveyed to us over the phone left out many important details, hence the reason we started asking him to email us all offers for us to look at for ourselves. The first weekend our house was on the market it was a holiday weekend, and unbeknownst to us Chris took the weekend off after we got 4 offers on our house. He ignored our texts and phone calls that weekend. We weren\u2019t able to address them until Monday morning when Chris checked back in, and at that point the offers were expiring that evening. About 99% of the time Chris made us feel like we were highly inconveniencing him, and that he didn\u2019t want to devote anymore time to us than he had to. Chris\u2019 guidance though the process of selling our home was nil. Educating us about the process \u2014 nil. Communication, a negative nil. He does get an A+ for selling himself very well for our initial phone call and interview\u2014beware, he is a very smooth talker and salesman. Chris is the 6th realtor that we\u2019ve worked with over decades of house sales and purchases. Fortunately, we had the privilege of working with a very professional realtor for our last house sale and purchase, and we are embarrassed to say that we took that level of professionalism and skill for granted. Selling your home is a stressful process and the wrong realtor can ratchet up that stress by 100x. Get a realtor that makes you feel like a valued client and that they have your best interests at heart.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Terrible agent.", "text": "Date of experience: July 01, 2021", "rating": 1}]

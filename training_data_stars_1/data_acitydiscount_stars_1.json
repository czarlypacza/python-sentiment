[{"title": "The frustration of placing my\u2026", "text": "The initial experience of placing my first order was far from customer-friendly. This establishment was recommended to me, so I decided to give them a call on Friday afternoon at around 1 pm. I urgently needed a Chef Base to be installed in our kitchen before the store opened, as the one we initially ordered did not meet the space requirements.I made sure to confirm that they were local to Georgia, and once verified, I proceeded to inquire about the availability of the product. Although the price was on the higher side, I deemed it fair since I could pick it up myself Sat morning. However, the trouble began right after that. They assured me that I could pick it up without any issues, but they didn't have the product on hand, rather had to go pick it up from 'up the street' so, I could get it first thing on Monday. To my disappointment, they informed me that it would only be available on Monday afternoon.To complete the transaction, I paid with the owner's credit card, just as we have done for our previous purchases totaling well over 400k. However, the customer service took a sharp decline from that point onwards. They requested a picture of the credit card, which I promptly sent. Then, on Monday morning, they demanded another picture of the owner with the credit card via text. Subsequently, they called again, insisting on a picture of the owner along with the credit card and his driver's license. Finally, before providing me with a pick-up time, they required an email from the owner granting permission for me to collect the item.Needless to say, this whole experience has been absolutely frustrating. The lack of service, reliability, and professionalism displayed by this establishment is unprecedented. As of 2:00 pm, I still lack confidence that the order, which has already been paid for, will be released for pick-up (or that they even have it) for the installers to proceed with the installation and meet the reschedule for sign-off. Each call only added to the mounting frustration. I even asked to speak with the person responsible for these verification policies, but to no avail - there were no calls from them whatsoever.Nowhere on their website or the paid invoice was there any mention of such a stringent verification policy. We operate in the hospitality industry, and up until this point, every single supplier, vendor, and partner has gone above and beyond to ensure a pleasant experience. Unfortunately, this was not the case here. Never before have I encountered such a poor purchasing experience, especially when dealing with all the necessary equipment, services, and contracts required to open multiple restaurants. This was an unfortunate first for us in the hospitality industry, as our previous encounters with suppliers, vendors, and partners have always been exceptional.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "P Point Market", "text": "My Company, P Point Market has purchased kitchen equipment from A City Discount (03/25/2019)The store instead of placing a balance back in our credit card, placed a IS Credit ($3,798.00).When the issue was found, I contacted ACity to get the balance back into my account.

I have video and pictures documented and sent to ACityDiscount. However, ACityDiscount said the driver was disputing my word so they would not give me the refund, without more investigation. It wasn't until started calling twice a week did I get to speak to a manager, Summer. She was extremely rude and curt. Larry and Brian were always very pleasant when I talked with them, (many times I might add) but they were unable to resolve the issue without me going over their heads. A little kindness goes a long way.

True only covers their compressors for 5 years and will not cover it because the unit is 12 years old. When delivered there was a USED sticker on the freezer and they still claimed it was new.  These folks are crooks.  There service manager is arrogant and rude and claims the unit was never even turned on and checked yet they still would not fix the compressor.   By the way....The Better Business Bureau has 11 complaints logged against this business!!!  Live & Learn.  Your reply below is a lie.  The unit was manufactured in 2005 according to True who said they would have honored the warranty on the compressor.  True stated you cannot sell a piece of their equipment that was manufactured 12 years prior as new, but you did.  Never been used huh, I guess that's why you guys slapped a USED sticker on the unit.

I emailed Justin who I purchased it through and received no response. After a couple of weeks, Mike emailed me back saying that I only ordered one bracket and any others would have to be purchased. I asked follow-up questions, again thinking there should be two arms and received no response. I sent two more follow up emails with no response to Mike. I emailed the customer service email describing the service I received, funny enough it went to Mike. He did email me back, saying he did not see any order I have ever placed, nor does he have an account with my name on it. I have spent over $10,000 at ACD in the past year. I responded again with all of my information and have yet to received a response back, this was 5 days ago.Some of the salesmen may be great, but if they have to answer to this guy for any issues that come up I can promise you that you will not be taken care of as a customer.

Now it is time to use the warranty and I find out from the company there never was a warranty attached with these units!  ACity had even listed these units touting the company's warranty as 'the best in the business with 3 years bumper to bumper'.  They NEVER indicated these were being sold without a warranty.  Even my invoice states these items as being 'NEW' not used or discontinued models.  My disgust with Acity stems from their REFUSAL to call me back or put someone on the line when I call who can help!  They will not even be respectful enough to return a phone call.  Coldtech execs were very upset to hear of these practices and have since contacted Acity.  I am sure this feedback will do little to make them call or uphold the warranty they advocated with the units.  I hate to go to the Consumer Protection Agency and BBB but maybe that is my only course of action here as everyone at ACity is in hiding.

Didn't work at all when finally plugged in (mid November)  I did call \"A City Discount\" and left a message.  No reply.  Spent $894.29 on refrigeration repair (just got the bill now, hence the review).  It was made operational, but leaking water into freezer compartment.  Then this week, the kitchen filled with a burnt electric smell and it went dead again.  Parts are on now on order. I had ordered equipment from them before, so, as a return customer, was hoping to at least get a return call.  No such luck.  My advice: don't go for their used equipment. My repairman says that the unit clearly had been worked on before as it had cheap replacement parts (which were the latest parts to fail).  I should have bought new, but I was caught needing to meet a health inspector's demands at a time where funds were short.  Now I'm out $2,900 and waiting on the next bill-- and I'll still have the leak in the freezer compartment to deal with... and I'm pretty sure I'll continue having issues.For $3,800 I could have bought a True T-49F new with 3 years warranty on parts and labor, 5 years on the compressor.Don't throw your hard-earned money away on folks who won't even return your call.

I called ahead and asked if they had continuous feed food processors in the showroom on display and the girl on the phone asked which brands and I told her and she said yes. So I drove 30 minutes to get there. When I walked in no one asked to help me so I asked where they would be. When I went to look there were none on display. On 2 brands in boxes, not on display and not one of the brand that I asked about. So I went back to the counter a 2nd time and had to interrupt a conversation between 2 employees to ask if there were any out in the store somewhere. The answer was no. So I went back to the shelf looking for the brand that I was interested in and could not see it. I looked on line and it said it was in stock (which I checked before driving so far).  So I went back to the counter a 3rd time and once again had to stop their conversation (between 2 employees) and ask if someone could help me. The girl asked what I needed, so I proceeded to ask about the appliance. She did not know what I was talking about so I showed her on my phone and that it was in stock but I could not see it anywhere. She looked it up and said it was online only. I asked her why it said \"in stock\" , she had no answer. And STILL no offered to go back to the shelf with me and take a look. I told her that I called before I came and drove 30 minutes to look at a product that was supposedly in stock. I was exasperated at the level of customer service and knowledge of their products. I just walked out. Don't expect any sort of help if you go to this store.Update after response 12/2/21I did not ask for a specific model. I wanted to see the brand which was not on the shelf and showed as \"In stock\" on your website, which I was told was not kept in the store and online only.

Everyone understands that. You ordered a wrong size, we used a wrong thread color. You gave us the wrong date, we sent it to the wrong address.

It's very risky to order from Queensboro and you could easily get into a HUGE mess with your business plans by investing your trust in this company. In short, they failed to deliver, sold something that is out of stock, and refused to do the right thing.  Here's the important details:\r First, the order didn't arrive on time because apparently the company was out of stock on ONE PARTICULAR item in the order, which could have been fine and a fixable situation if I knew about the problem in a reasonable time, however, nobody called me to tell me that the order wasn't being delivered.  I had several different items ordered, and they held the entire order back because of their own internal stocking issue, which is strange because their website tells whether something is in stock or not BEFORE you can purchase it, because it's an inventory software, so really I don't know if that \"out of stock\" excuse was legit anyway...\r So, it's a week past the worse case delivery date I was given, and I have a promotion schedule for the upcoming week and naturally I need my promo gear that I ordered 3 weeks ago, so i call them.  They tell me this reason for non-delivery (one item out of stock) and after I tell them my situation, they still won't rush out the rest of my order to me so I can have all the other items.  Instead, they ask ME what they want ME to do about it, as if I'M running their business and customer service department.\r I ask them to ship the rest asap.  They say No, it will all be shipped to you on July 6th (which would be 34 days from the day I ordered it all, which is also 20 days past their promised shipping date, AND which is over a week past MY SCHEDULED PROMO event that requires uniform (logo'd) gear to work it).\r UNBELIEVABLE, right?  Well believe it, because it gets worse.  \r So, I email the founder, Fred Meyers.  He gets all the emails on his cell phone.  Yeah, how do i know that?  His staff told me.  The same staff that basically told me \"tough cookies\" on my entire order.  So, I know Fred got my email(s).  Fred doesn't respond to me though, he has his assistant EMAIL ME telling me that they are refunding my money but they still won't ship me my other items i need, and they ask me to give them a chance to make up for it better in the future!  Ha, seriously?  In the future?  They could make up for it right now! \r I end up having to miss the entire weeks scheduled promo because I don't have the logo'd clothing, and i look like a total unprofessional flake to the venues and staff.  Because I actually care about people and my reputation (unlike Fred Meyers and Queensboro obviously), I will end up paying staff for their troubles of missed day, and I'll have to order a lot more swag to give away and make it a big blowout event so I redeem my reputation as someone who delivers like they say they will.  This will cost me a lot of money to make up for Queensboro's neglectful business standards by not letting me know that they decided to hold hostage my entire order because one piece need to be restocked, which shouldn't even have that problem since they have inventory control in their software!!!   \r So when I get the email from the assistant telling me they are refunding my money, I tell them that the money is not the issue!  The huge nightmare that their neglectful business practice has caused me is the problem.  And I ask them to help me redeem my situation as it has caused a huge snowball nightmare for multiple people and left me in a bad reputation situation.  And what answer did I get from this request to do what's right??  I GET TOTALLY IGNORED.  \r I emailed the assistant twice and I even emailed Fred Meyers directly again.  NO RESPONSE.  But the very next two days in a row I get emails from Fred promoting sales he is having.  \r You can imagine the frustration here.   Save yourself the hassle.  There's not a dollar amount you could pay me to go through that again.  My reputation is crushed and Queensboro deserves to pay restitution on that.  Which sounds like a good next step actually.", "rating": 1}]

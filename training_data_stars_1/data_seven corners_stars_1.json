Seven Corners argues that there is NO coverage for the 3-night MEDICAL delay as it is not \"interruption,\" not \"delayed\" as the trip didn't start, and not canceled as I will be making the rest of the trip.  So NO Claim is possible even with medical necessity/form. Also, if I filed a claim for those first three nights, the rest of the trip is NOT covered as 1 claim voids out coverage for the rest of the trip I can make.They offered to let me buy a NEW policy for my new dates if I were to file a claim, which they indicated would be denied anyway.  Or the other option is just don't file a claim (absorb the 3-night non-refundable), and then they can adjust the policy to start the trip three days later, which I can then fully cancel if I want.  The logic escapes me as the entire trip amount is 10X the price of 3 nights.

They ask for  things like credit card statement showing you paid for cruise. Then we waited 6 weeks, and heard nothing.

After many hoops, we got a final stateroom bill from Princess cruises and submitted it to 7C. But I believe the stall tactic and the ridiculous \"proof of payment\" was merely an effort to not pay a legitimate claim. The bean counters at 7C know that the more hoops they make people jump through, the fewer claims they have to pay. 7 Corners is not an honest company when it comes to paying claims and their responsiveness (or lack thereof) in customer service is pathetic.

This includes all charges and credits (I had several hundred dollars of credits after a port-of-call was cancelled at which I had paid for an activity, I cancelled a specialty dinner, and had a $100 credit as part of booking promotion).

With no rooms left at hotel to stay in place and travel with the group no longer an option our travel agent got us a flight to return home. We immediately filed a claim and were told to expect to hear within 90 days. After 90 days and multiple calls/delays we were told the claim would be escalated. After approximately 110 days we filed a complaint with our state insurance commission. After hearing from the commissioner 7 Corners contacted our travel agent who was asked who made the decision to terminate our travels. She indicated she had due to the lack of medical help available. The result was a quick response denying our claim, indicating we did not get an in-country medical diagnosis prior to leaving. At that time all special COVID testing sites both in the city and at the airport had been shut down. We immediately contacted our Primary Physicians once returning and quarantined. 7 Corners then pointed to the policy's clause that a medical professional diagnosis was required prior to leaving our trip. Bottom line: 120 days later, no one at 7 Corners would direct us to a supervisor, claim denied after many efforts to speak to someone about the claim and delays only to get a perfunctory denial. We do not feel that 7 Corners ever gave our claim a serious review and found a clause to cancel after hearing from the Insurance Commissioner. Per their policy, they had the right to deny but did not require 120 days and the run around, delays and no consideration of the COVID circumstances. I am adding the following as an edit since you offered no \u201creply\u201d option, My post was not about time to getting an answer. It was about the failure to speak forthrightly and the denial during the COVID period when norms were severely impacted, including the availability of medical services while nearly everyone had access to self testing and instructions to quarantine unless symptoms were severe.You reply is as insulting as our experience attempting to get some consideration for our loss while insured by 7 Corners.Allow me to make a specific ask.

My experience with Seven Corners has been absolutely terrible. I plan to describe it on social media so that others can understand and avoid the frustration I have been through. I filed my claim almost 5 months ago! Since then I have spent countless hours with Seven Corners customer service trying to get my claim processed. I even asked to have it expedited for financial reasons. Nothing.For starters, I spent several weeks communicating and sending documentation to wrong companies who had received my claim. It seemed my claim was being sent  around to several wrong companies, perhaps a Starr Insurance (?) and then 2 other companies called Squaremouth and Broadspire.  I spent hours filling out my claim information on these incorrect online sites, sending followup emails and speaking with their service reps. I was then told by a company, perhaps Starr,  to contact Seven Corners, again sending all my documentation to your site. After going back and forth regarding details of my submittal, including the absence of my bank's logo on my online bank statement, which the bank does not provide, I was assured I would get my refund in early October.When I called, about the 8th time for a status, I was told I needed to sign a \"Disclosure to Release Funds\" which I was asked to send as, surprisingly, hadn't been sent. Had I not called, I probably would still be waiting for it. I returned it and heard nothing but \"You will receive an email notice when we send your check.\"Last week I sent another email to check on the status and received an email that \"we need the member's date of birth\". This seems like a series of innocuous requests from you company, over 5 months, to avoid payment. Pretty sure with all the documentation you have on hand from myself and John Handcock, whom you represent, that you already have that information.From my dealings in the business world , my experience here has been absolutely horrendous. I've heard excuses due to \"long refund times\" from Seven Corners, using COVID as an excuse, understaffing, etc. You would certainly think a company would increase their staff due to anticipation of increased claims from COVID.I plan to share this most frustrating and time-consuming experience, starting with Facebook and Yelp, for both John Hancock and Seven Corners.

I was told in writing that they would, so I trusted the Seven Corners agent that I was fully covered. Had I not been told this, I would have purchased new insurance.

Additionally, I have my policy statement for the new trip showing the initial deposit date as 2/10/23. I just received notification three months after filing the claim that Seven Corners has rejected my claim, stating that my initial deposit date (which they revised and are now saying was in May 2023 even though it is listed on my official policy as 2/10/23) was after my insurance purchase, not within the 20 day window as required, in spite of the documentation that the initial deposit was within 20 days, a email request from the claims reviewer to provide proof of that documentation (stating in that request that 2/10/23 was the \"initial deposit date,\" which later the company, in its denial, says it was not), and the email from their agent stating that my Cancel for Any Reason benefits remained intact for the new trip to Japan. I am most disappointed and have filed an appeal including this documentation. In the meantime, do yourself a favor and please do not trust this company. I purchased an expensive policy in good faith and followed the advice of their agent and claims reviewer, only to find that they denied my claim based on information that is not what is clearly listed on my policy (initial deposit date) and was advised in writing by their own agents.

My daughter tested positive days before the trip. I emailed Seven Corners a few times asking if they needed anything other than what was on the list they provided me and that I had sent them. My daughter was asymptomatic, the covid numbers were high, and everyone was told NOT to go to the doctor unless they needed to. I called Seven Corners and asked if my daughter needed to see a doctor for insurance reasons. I was told that she did NOT need to see a doctor because no matter what a doctor said, she still would not be allowed to fly. I submitted the insurance claim immediately. The time frames given proceeded to get longer and longer. It's now been 5 months and I received a denial letter stating she was denied because she didn't see a doctor. They had only been talking to me, her mom, for the entire 5 months. After I said I was going to make a formal complaint, they said they needed to verify me. Then they said they couldn\u2019t speak to me unless my daughter, who was a minor when we got the insurance, signed a form stating they could talk to me. In the meantime, I reached out to my daughter's teacher and explained the situation. They responded to her saying, \u201cOur Traveler Support Team has processed Clarice\u2019s claim and is refunding $4,070.\u201d They never asked the teacher to get authorization. When I reached out to them regarding what the teacher showed me, they denied me again. Simply put, this company is immoral. ***The insurance was taken out BEFORE covid was a thing. And we know that covid changed everything. Which is why when I called the insurance company and spoke to an agent I said, Is there anything else I need to do? Does my daughter need to see a doctor for insurance reasons? Because she can't go no matter what. Seeing the doctor makes no difference. The rep responded with, exactly. No she does not need to see a doctor. The PCR test is the only thing needed. This was during a time when covid numbers were high and the United States government asked that people who tested positive for covid, that were not seriously ill, NOT take up space so more sick people could be seen. This was the government asking. And I STILL asked Seven Corners if I should take my daughter in. Seven Corners said that I did NOT need to have my daughter seen. I don't think listening to the government and also double checking with the insurance company should result in my claim being denied.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Honest Review - Would NOT Recommend", "text": "Unfortunately, I must agree with the negative reviews for this company.  I have used Square Mouth to purchase cruise travel insurance for years and have always purchased the same policy.  As most of the positive reviews here state, the purchase itself was easy and smooth.  Having to file my first ever claim to be reimbursed a small amount of money ($1430) because I tested positive for COVID after getting off a ship in Vancouver which prevented me from flying home, has been a disaster in terms of dealing with Seven Corners.  The claim was filed on 5/22/22 with all the required documentation.  Made double sure to include everything requested, outlined it, highlighted it and everything was straightforward.  Waited 30 days before first follow-up via e-mail.  Received a response telling me they were \"upset about the wait time too\" and \"to be assured my claim would be reviewed\" and they would \"e-mail me every 3 weeks with an update on my claim.\"  Over the course of the next few MONTHS I had be the initiator for follow-up and only then would I get the same \"form\" e-mail telling me the the exact same information.    Finally on 9/14/22 I received a different request.  They now wanted a copy of my credit card statement showing I had, in fact, paid the charges submitted.  That was the only thing requested and I sent this information back via e-mail the same day.From that point - radio silence.  Reached out several times over the next few weeks and couldn't even warrant a reply of the standard \"form\" e-mail telling me they were \"upset about the wait time too.\"Finally I reached out to Square Mouth, the 3rd party vendor I purchased the policy through.  They have a \"Zero Complaint\" department to assist with just such issues.  I scheduled a phone meeting with one of Square Mouth's \"Zero Complaint\" representatives.  We had our conversation on 11/2/22 and she stated she would send a follow-up request to Seven Corners.  I know this will sound unbelievable but Seven Corners actually sent an email to me within 48 hours - denying my claim.  The money is not the issue, it's not a large amount.  The aggravating part is they only responded after I got Square Mouth involved, and then apparently decided quickly to just deny and move on. The reason for denying was due to me not going to a physician (in Vancouver) and getting diagnosed with COVID and then having said physician \"restrict\" my travel.  Seriously Seven Corners?  The UNITED STATED OF AMERICA CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL had a mandate in place back in May which clearly stated if you tested positive for COVID within one (1) day of a scheduled flight into the United States, you were NOT allowed to fly into the United States and would be denied boarding.  I didn't need a physician to restrict me, the U.S. Government did.  I did, however, submit a video proctored COVID test which confirmed my positive results.   Further, why did Seven Corners request a copy of my credit card statement if this is the reason behind them denying my claim?  Doesn't make a lot of sense. So, to control costs (i.e. 10 day hotel bill for quarantine), I booked travel from Vancouver to Seattle via bus, as land borders had no restrictions for entering the U.S., and I changed my flight from Vancouver to Seattle (domestic flights did not require tests).  I double-masked up and got home without having a huge bill to file with, what I thought was, my quality travel insurance plan.  Instead what I got from them was nothing.  Lesson learned.  Sorry for such a long post, but consumers deserve to know what others go through with a company.  If you're fair, you deserve praise and good reviews.  Unfortunately, Seven Corners does not deserve a pat on the back for the way they handle claims.PLEASE, Seven Corners, do not ask ME to reach out to you via email as you have done so much on this board.  I've done enough of that.

The one star reviews are from those of us who actually tried to file and collect on a claim. It took Seven Corners over four months to decide to deny my two claims. The reasons for they gave for denial are worth noting, should you consider purchasing a travel policy from them. My first claim was for expenses incurred when my outbound international flight was canceled less than 24 hours prior to departure. As a result I was charged for a no-show at my hotel. However, my claim was denied solely because I had prepaid for my hotel. Per my denial letter \"your Trip Delay coverage only covers Reasonable Expenses that were a direct result of the delay and had nothing to do with any pre-paid expenses like the hotel that charged you no-show fees.\" My second claim was based on contracting Covid while on my trip. As a result I was unable to return as scheduled and had to pay for flight change fees and additional nights at a hotel until I tested negative and could board a plane - ironically, the precise situation for which I got insurance! However, my claim was denied because my positive diagnosis was made in a mandated government clinic rather than being \"... examined, treated, and ordered to quarantine by a legally qualified physician and have documentation of said quarantine order...\"Lessons learned: 1) if your trip is delayed, don't expect any prepaid charges to be reimbursed, and 2) if you are unlucky enough to contract Covid on your trip,  don't expect a diagnosis from a mere government clinic (the one you have to visit to be cleared to depart) will be sufficient to claim your Covid-related expenses. In summary, my trip was a complete bummer, and the small measure of security I'd hoped to achieve through my Seven Corners policy was an utter waste of money.

I currently still have a claim open from over year ago! And this is not the first time this happened. They ask for the same documents over and over again, tell you to contact doctors offices to request documents they also have already sent multiple times. You have to deal with a different person every time. You spend hours on the phone for nothing, and in the end, end up paying the full bills directly to the provider, who is, by this point quite upset. Things got so bad that I ended up getting another insurance in top of this one (since it was mandatory) over the past months. And guess what, I have had no problems with this other health insurance. They do what they said they would do when I signed up. My claims are reviewed within a couple of weeks. I don't have to send never ending paperwork. No more headaches!!!

Finally an agent called back and said she could provide a claim from as well as a few medical referals for Budapest.   She also advised for  a claim to possibly be reviewed, it was required to have positive PCR test even though US regulations accept antigen test.   Also required was a Physician's Statement.   She also did not know if the claim would be for Trip Delay or Trip Interruption.   I felt there was very little help/assistance.    They fact I couldn't get a hold of them for 6 hours makes me extremely disappointed.     I just called Customer Service to ask about claim filing on 4/13/2022 and answering service advised to expect a call back in 1 to 2 days!!

We purchased cancel at anytime insurance in early March of 2020 in case we needed to cancel our Dec 2020 trip due to covid19 situation.  We did end up canceling our trip but we were not able to get any refunds for our trip insurance.  This trip insurance will ONLY refund you if no refunds or other other forms of compensation including airline miles are offered.  So in other words, before you can apply for any cancel at anytime funds you must first contact your hotel/rental, car rental, airline and prove to 7 corners they would not refund you.  In my case luckily our home rental refunded us so it was stupid of us to pay for insurance to cover this.  Our airline made us get letter from my doctor saying I was high risk for covid and should not fly.  Then they gave us flight credits that were going to expire within 3 months (when it probably wasn\u2019t going to be any safer for me to fly).  I explained the situation to seven corner several times and all of the representatives I spoke with told me to deny the airline credits.

So in my case it was really just a waste of money to even purchase the insurance.

Unfortunately Sven Corners did not perform as expected on either one of these.  I chose Seven Corners over several other insurance providers based on the assurance from the sales rep that 1) claims were paid quickly and 2) medical evacuation would be quickly handled by Seven Corners staff.  Unfortunately, It is now 4 months after my trip and several large claims including my medical evacuation travel home are still unpaid even though I provided all of the required documentation.  The sales rep also promised that in the event of a medical emergency that Seven Corners would arrange and pay for medical evacuation expenses.  While swimming in Indonesia I contracted a severe viral infection in my right eye, it has caused an ulcer on my cornea and was rapidly degrading my eyesight so that I could not see out of my right eye.  The local Bali doctors gave me anti-biotics initially and later anti-viral medication but they were not strong enough and unable to diagnose the infection properly.  I went to several eye care specialists in Bali and none were able to diagnose or fix it.  I sent photos of my results to my optometrist at home and they told me it was a VERY SERIOUS viral infection and to RETURN HOME IMMEDIATELY or I may lose sight in my right eye.  I called and email Seven Corners several time to arrange immediate flights home for me and my girlfriend.  At this point I could not see out of my right eye.  She was not going to continue her trip without me and I needed here assistance getting to the airport.  Note, she is also covered under the same Seven Corners insurance plan.  Seven Corners did not respond for over 24 hours and the phone lines were busy or I was on hold for up to an hour at which time I tried emailing assist and claims for support.  I finally received an email telling me THEY COULDNT HELP ME and to ARRANGE TRAVEL HOME ON MY OWN.  They also emailed me a fit to fly form that needed to be signed by a doctor before I flew.  If you've ever traveled to Indonesia you know that calling a hospital to get an appointment is useless and that the lines to see a doctor may be several hours, not to mention access to a laptop to fill out a form and print and sign it is not happening.  This was the week of March 15th so at the same time many people were trying to fly home for COVID so the airline were difficult to get reservation on.  I found an airline and booked the $2700 tickets home.  I submitted the claim immediately upon returning home.  Seve Corners then asked for forms filled out by my doctor, which I completed and also scans of our passports shown entry and exit dates, which I completed and sent (they lost those emails and asked me to resubmit 3 months after submitting the claim).  So LONG STORY SHORT, I am out of pocket THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND SEVEN CORNERS HAS STILL NOT PAID 4 MONTHS LATER AND IS MAKING ME JUMP THROUGH MORE INSURANCE HOOPS TO GET A CLAIM PAID.My right eyesight is now permanently blurred and I cant read out of it and it makes driving dangerous as my depth perception is gone.  My hope is that an insurance company would take care of you, especially when you are in a foreign country and unfamiliar with the medical system and transportation.  Seven Corners was of NO assistance to arrange medical evacuation and now 4 months later has still not paid for the bulk of expenses.  They did pay several small claims related to my eye and it seems their phone service is somewhat better now 4 months after the beginning of COVID.I would STRONGLY NOT RECOMMEND SEVEN CORNERS, its my opinion they are just out to make money off your premiums and do not have the support network to actually help you and they try to deny all of your claims requested additional information.

I am outraged that their website only pointed me as a customer to a list of approved service providers AFTER I made a purchase of the policy and not BEFORE, nor apprised me as POTENTIAL customer that it may happen that the top tier hospital in my vacation area may not be recognized by them. Shoppers must be able to determine -prepurchase- where Seven Corners coverage exists (and more importantly where it doesn't) so we can determine if coverage for our destination (coverage being defined as health care providers who have taken it upon themselves to reach out to and qualify with Seven Corners) is pointless in  case of an accident, e.g. if we cannot be relocated.In my case, I had something happen to me and I went to the number one hospital for the province we were staying, an island (with state of the art medical facilities) belonging to a developed, US friendly Asian country - a national university research-affiliated hospital that is basically the flagship for the entire area no less - for emergency surgery. $1200 and a lot of misplaced trust later, I found that Seven Corners does not have them on their online map of approved providers. So I was abandoned by Seven Corners' arcane and seemingly arbitrary policy of provider qualification. As happens so often with medical insurance providers I suspect the company will somehow try to construe this as having been my fault. EDIT: Thankfully, Seven Corners e-replied, but sadly after this review. Will follow up post-claims processing. Website still needs work.I want everyone to know of the shopping experience - specifically that Seven Corners only granted perusal of an approved provider list and map links (thereby alerting me to the fact that the top hospital in my destination may still not be accepted coverage) AFTER policy purchase was made. Their website design experience conveniently ensures that the utility of the policy is a crapshoot. Furthermore, in order for me to reach one of their nearest approved providers, I would have had to fly an extra $100+ and 70 minutes to the capitol, which was not an option due to the nature of the emergency. Evenso I attempted to engage their claims link process sent to me at policy expiration, in the hope they perhaps had merely committed an oversight in updating their website info.INCREDIBLY, the dropdown list of policy products to pick from in order to download correct claims forms and guides DOES NOT EVEN INCLUDE THE NAME OF MY ACTUAL PURCHASED POLICY!

Do I need to go over what is going to happen? I want to persevere and give the benefit of the doubt until an actual reply. But this American medical insurance company a) created and then b) avoided displaying a list of approved providers at purchase, designing their website so that provider qualifying info is hidden from consumer until after payment. I want to believe there is just a misunderstanding or some correctable red tape on the part of Seven Corners that they will fix or reach out on.I certainly understand about unlicensed medical practices & quacks overseas and the need of insurance companies to protect themselves. But these concerns simply do not apply in the case of my hospital. All reputable hospitals should be on their extremely restrictive and closely guarded list! and yet I am shut out in what appears an act of bad faith.This experience makes me feel I was taken by another bad US company. I think of Michael Moore's documentary Sicko and feel so stupid for having forgotten it and letting myself be used for having trusted Seven Corners to act right.

They let you buy a same day policy so you think it\u2019s effective but once you get your documents you see that coverage doesn\u2019t start until the following day.

It has nothing to do with a travel delay causing a missed airline connection. Third. Trip delay insurance is only in effect if you are more than 100 miles from home. So, if you have a prepaid vacation or non-refundable flight/hotel and your first leg is cancelled, you have zero coverage. And it\u2019s not cheap insurance. My policy was over $250 yet paid nothing when my flight was cancelled by the airline. I believe my circumstance would be the most common reason to have travel insurance and this policy pays zero. I can\u2019t imagine a more crooked/dishonest business practice. Thanks Chris Elliott, travel ombudsman for recommending this waste of a policy. Lesson learned though.

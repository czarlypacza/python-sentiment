The Home inspection had a lot of problems and even had a large hole in the roof with rain going inside the house. We cancelled the RE Contract ASAP. We contacted the Broker and sent a copy of the cancellation to her as well. She said I will get my refund back in 10 days. After 10 days we still did not get our refund and spoke to the Supervisor and she said it was processed 3 days ago. Also she said the refund was only 300.00 and that they charged us 100.00 per person for the hard credit pull. When I heard that I hit the wall. I told the supervisor(Angela Ramos) that it is against the customer loan protection law that you can not charge a borrower without disclosing the cost so the borrower can decide if they want this done.

Each week, I was told that the loan should be wrapped up and ready for closing, but instead it was just one issue after another. All the issues I was told (excuses is what I actually started to believe) was that there were technical challenges, issues with appraisal (back and forth between drive-by and hard appraisal), the SSN transposed so the IRS couldn't provide the information needed, documents not properly being reviewed/audited before forwarding to the IRS, paperwork to the IRS not being completed, requests to physically print and sign documents (when they could all be done electronically) so taking the time to physically drive to a location to print and scan a single document, not being given the correct information up-front such as closing cost information, being told our credit was good enough to be approved for the amount requested, but then being told later we needed to pay down a credit card to a certain amount, and then in the end, still not getting the amount requested because the appraisal didn't come back at the amount they were initially thinking. Each time an issue came up, it would take 3 to 5 business days for that issue to get resolved. The list goes on.

The initial purchase of my home, the process took a bit over a month to get through and they required verification of every cent of my worth, but could not count money I had taken out of the bank to purchase a vehicle, which I ended up returning the same money into the bank. Due to this I needed to muster another $3,000 because that cash could not be 'verified.' I came up with the money, they re-ran their math prior to closing and told me I was $37.00 short. I said you have to be kidding me, and sent a photo of 2 $20.00 bills in my wallet (though they would be unverified). They actually managed to close even though they couldn't verify these $37.I was contacted every six months about refinancing, usually to go through the process and get credit checked and talk with them for a couple weeks, just to end up with \"Well there isn't anything better we can do for you.\" This went on for a few years. Once I was able to refinance and it went without much fuss besides reverification of all finances.In the attempt to take out equity in the home, I was told they close on the loans in 1-2 weeks. They required a home appraisal, and the soonest someone could get out was 2.5 weeks away. During this time I verified all income and taxes, and awaited the appraisal. The meeting went without a hitch, mentioning I may just have to put exterior trim back on a window that was replaced. The appraisal took ~1 week to get, and mentioned they 'Recommended' I have my woodstove inspected. Rocketmortage told me when an appraiser says 'Recommend' it means 'Requires' and told me I would have to foot the bill for the inspection of the stove (although I was charged $965 for the appraisal that \"Required\" this). The soonest someone could inspect the stove was over 1 week away. During this time I questioned the rates and charges I had noticed on the paperwork. They added \"Discount Points\" on the sale to the sum of $1237.00, and after 2 days of attempting to get an answer as to what each point was worth in its percentage reduction on the rate, I concluded it would take 40 months to recoup the cost incurred. I asked to remove the points, as rates would probably drop and I would refinance within that timeframe. I was told if I did that, it would increase my rate by another 0.75% on top of the points-worth, because that changed my DTI. In essence I was stuck with spending the money on the discount points just to lose later.After a week of waiting for the inspection of the stove, I was told I needed to move it to provide clearances to the tile. I was out of town and had a friend move and reinstall the stove to the specifications provided, and photograph the measurements. I sent the photos to the inspector, and was ignored for 2 days before being told it actually needed to be moved to different measures, although no one would be around now to move it. I would have to move it three days later when I returned. The window trim was requested just before this time, and the project was completed and photographed to detail, and proof provided to Rocketmortgage. I was told it would have to be photographed by the appraiser, and he would have to come back out to do so. This was scheduled 2.5 weeks away as the soonest it was possible. My patience ran thin, and it made no sense, as I run a construction company and this is our business. On a whim working with a great member of the company she thought we could potentially provide the underwriters with a letter stating how it was done and signed by those in the business. This was provided. Underwriters have now taken 1.5 weeks to review information, and were asked to expedite, and asked for status, and we have largely been ghosted and dragged on. Asked for status on Friday and Saturday, just to be told Monday that the letter needs another signature and date.I am not one to write reviews, ever. This I felt needed to be known that the company in question has such a lack of humanity they will do you no favors, help you zero, and it is truly about profits. If you want it to be easy, I have found this is far from it. I am currently at about 60 days waiting for this to close, and those at the top do not care one bit to move things along, regardless of your situation.I began using Rocketmortgage due to them being the most affordable at the time. From my experiences in the last five years, I will be leaving them regardless of price, they are by far one of the worst companies to do business with. There are great people working for them, and I truly hope they leave and find a place that can allow them to help people like they desire, not just to be a cog for this dispenser of plutocratic red tape.

This was very deceptive and put us in a situation where we felt like we had no choice but to go through with these changed terms or risk losing out on the house.

This time around, not so much.The process at first seemed easy this time around.  Brad seemed nice and was helpful.  Unfortunately, things changed.  We decided not to purchase our mother's home and instead do a refinance in a trust created for our mother.  We got the information and then began the process on our end and things started to get ridiculous and frustrating.From the information that they kept asking for over and over, even after things had been provided multiple times.  I had to keep calling to tell Brad to let the team know that it had been provided.  Speaking to Brad (our contact there) also became more like speaking to a used car salesman around the middle of the process too.  We had specifically told him that we weren't going to be using family equity during the process at all yet it kept being put into the mix, including when we got paperwork and requests for information about said equity.  When I spoke to him after I received the request, his response was \"Oh, I thought we were going to use it\".  It was made VERY clear that it wasn't going to be used.  They had also given us rates based on the approximate appraised value that BRAD gave us.  When the official appraisal from their service came back, it was $25K HIGHER.  We were told that we would have to pay points to keep the rate at where we were told.  When questioned, Brad told us that it basically came down to the loan to value and it needed to be another $25K higher.  When I asked why we were told a lower rate when we a) had been basing it on his estimated value and b) he KNEW the amount of the loan from the start, he said there was nothing that could be done.  Yes there was..... tell us a rate based on the information provided from the beginning.While my mother was the owner of the trust, she is on SSI and makes under $2,000 a month.  As such, we were using the trustees incomes as we are all working.  When my mother made a purchase on a store credit card for $100, they nagged us for the statement as the card had just been opened.  They saw what the amount was and, when I said it's a $300k mortgage and we aren't using her credit as backing, it still took WEEKS to get resolved when I sent them the info.  Seriously?!?!?  It isn't even a blip compared to the amount we are borrowing and our incomes outside of my mother were what was being used.

There were things we were told that we found out after closing weren't factual. Like when our first payment would be due. We, also, found out after closing that the the checks that were issued to payoff for some of the accounts were short and we, the client, would be responsible to pay any overages!Also, after closing on the loan, they realized one of the payoffs of one of the accounts we were paying off had expired so they held ALL the other checks from being dispersed on time. This caused us to have to make some payments on accounts that we shouldn't have had to but the payments were due. These were accounts that were supposed to have been paid off by then.Now here we are just two weeks away from our first payment due and instead of being able to save up for it we're having to pay payments and overages on accounts that were supposed to have been paid off at the beginning of the month.We are definitely frustrated with something that could have been a lot smoother if Rocket Mortgage took better care of the client!

I regret that decision.It started by Rocket erroneously telling us that if we use one of their realtors we would have $10k back. We used their realtors instead of using one of our great realtor that had helped us in the past. The realtor that Rocket recommended was not good! Sometimes it felt they were not sure of what was going on and definitely felt they were not on our side.Then, later on the process (a few days before our closing date) we were informed that due to a mistake, Rocket could not give us the promised 10k. The agent assigned to our case said it was her mistake and that she gave us the wrong information and that unfortunately she would not be able to give us the promised 10k. She said she would make up to us and give us $5k. Because we were so close to the closing day we had no option but to accept it. Then, on the day before the closing that person assigned to our case called us to give the final numbers and then informed us that she wouldn\u2019t be able to give us $5k but $3k and that she gave us a discount on something that until today I have no idea what it was. That was so frustrating and I felt fooled or that we are stupid for trusting this company.Also, we had informed multiple times that we did not want to buy points in order to make our rate lower. On the day before our closing we were informed that we paid $17k to lower the rate (I was furious but again couldn\u2019t say anything because it was the day before our closing date, also it was like 6pm at night!)We also said that we would not like more than $20k back. This person again ignored us and gave us $50k back instead of using this money on the payment of the house.These things made my family and I not trust rocket anymore and we can\u2019t wait to refinance with another company!No one listened to us, it was all about the money!Also, the other agent assigned to us decided that it was not enough time to close on our house on the day stipulated on the contract, because the appraiser (request by Rocket) was late on delivering his report. If that would had happened we would had lost our deposit of $17k and probably lost our house. I had to call this guy crying and I desperately beg the him to not postpone the closing date. I explained that it was not our fault but the appraiser and finally he agreed to not postponed. Later on the closing we found out that this person was going to be out that day and probably that was why he didn\u2019t want to close on the day on the contract!It was so unfortunate and disappointing working with Rocket! I didn\u2019t expect that on the purchase of our house specially having a \u201crelationship\u201d with the company for so many years!We felt we were mislead on borrowing more money than necessary, buying points against our will and deceived into this \u201cuse our realtors and get some money back\u201d.

", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Rocket Denied Us Our Lender Credit 3 Days Before Closing ", "text": "We are purchasing a home and agreed to proceed with Rocket Mortgage based on an interest rate that included points purchased for $6,694, which were being covered by a $6,694 lender credit (LC). The loan included a shortage for 1.5% points. Other lenders had provided us with identical interest rates, but without the need to buy down the rate. Our agent provided the LC to bring their loan offer in-line with the competition. We explicitly told our agent that we did not use a Rocket Homes agent for our home purchase, but they assured us that the LC would be applied regardless due to management approval. Closing was scheduled for 2.5 weeks later. We received a Loan Estimate a week later that removed the LC. When questioned on the change, our agent assured us it was a technical issue that would be resolved. 6 days later, we received another updated Estimate that removed both the shortage and the LC. I flagged the issue again for Rocket but they didn't inform us until a week before closing that the LC was intentionally removed by their underwriters, due to the fact we didn't use a Rocket Homes agent, but they assured us they were working on a solution. 3 days before closing the agent finally came clean and told us Rocket would not honor the original terms of our agreement. The agent admitted they attempted to \"sneak [the lender credit] past\" underwriting, which management confirmed was not possible. We could either accept the shortage credit or the LC, but not both. Throughout this process the agent routinely failed to respond to calls and texts requesting to discuss the issue. As of closing, Rocket has acknowledged all of these events took place and that our original terms were approved by the capital markets team, but they refused to honor this approval because of their own agent's deception. Our options were to proceed with Rocket without the promised credit or lose the home. I've seen other posts discussing similar behavior so it appears to be a patter to pull in clients.

My journey with Rocket Mortgage turned into an absolute nightmare, leaving me frustrated and utterly disappointed. I was initially attracted by their slick advertising and promises of a hassle-free, efficient mortgage process. However, the reality was far from what was promised.First and foremost, the communication was horrendous. I was passed around from one representative to another, each time having to re-explain my situation. It was as if my file was lost in a black hole, with little to no updates unless I bombarded them with calls and emails. And even then, the information given was contradictory, leaving me confused about the status of my application.The lack of transparency was appalling. Hidden fees started to emerge out of nowhere, significantly increasing the cost beyond what was initially discussed. It was like a bad magic show where every trick was designed to make more money disappear from my pocket. The final closing costs were shockingly higher than the Good Faith Estimate, which was a bitter pill to swallow.Furthermore, the processing time was painfully slow. What was advertised as a rocket-speed process turned out to be more like a bicycle with flat tires. Constant need for unnecessary documentation became the norm, not the exception, causing significant stress until my final hours of closing. I have been faithful in my patience of processes because with my numerous years of being a government employee but this process was a test of my faith. My company Lockheed Martin referred them and this felt like a betrayal, considering the amount of time and energy I had invested in this process. In conclusion, my experience with Rocket Mortgage was far from the fast, friendly, and straightforward process they advertise. It was a sequence of mismanaged steps, lack of transparency, and utter disregard for the customer's time and money.

The processor assigned to our case did not show much care to our case and made multiple mistakes. Her phone calls seems rushed every time, and it felt like we were just an item on her daily to-do list. She asked us multiple times for the same task items that we advised her on, and she didn\u2019t understand what we were telling her. She reached out to our realtor for information, but when our realtor ask for clarifying details the processor forgot to send a reply for over a week and we had to call her to get the information moving along.2. Whoever sent information to the appraiser third party was not sending the correct information or enough information. We were purchasing a home over 4 states away from the house we were purchasing, so we had very limited information and access to the property. We advised rocket mortgage to contact and work with the builder and our realtor, which they had all the contact information for. The first appraiser called us, the BUYER, to ask for access to the property. Not only did we not have access to the property that day or the next day. Not only were we 4 states away, we were the buyers and couldn\u2019t get access to the new construction. Then the appraiser did not even know it was a new construction, Rocket Mortgage failed to convey this information. The first appraisal was cancelled as the appraiser wanted the house to be fully complete. We had to work with processor again to get another appraisal order, which AGAIN they called THE BUYERS not the realtor, or the builder to get access to the property. The mix up on the appraisal was a massive headache and had us calling the other parties in the process multiple times to get the appraisal on track.3. When it came to finalizing the loan numbers, we had not heard from the loan officer once we were passed off to the processor unless we reached out. We received multiple new disclosures in our rocket mortgage account that contained the incorrect and/or incomplete information. The new disclosures gave us absolutely no comfort about where the loan stood, or what our final numbers would look like. We were advised by the loan officer multiple times to just not look at the new disclosures that go out until the final one as they are incorrect\u2026.I don\u2019t understand why the system would continually send out disclosures that are incorrect and misleading.4. When we were sent the closing specialist, again it felt like just a person that wanted to check the box on the to do\u2019s. The experience was not personal or comforting at all. When making a large purchase it is VERY uncomfortable when we get a call and the individuals barely know our names. Then the starting throwing out numbers that don\u2019t align to what we were just told the day before by the loan officer.5. Rocket Mortgage was given the CORRECT tax number by the closing attorney and they complete ignored the amount. They used their third party who did not understand the tax laws for the area, and completely missed a credit that would apply to our primary residence. The value Rocket Mortgage wanted to use for the tax number was 2.5x larger than it actually should have been. This would have increased our closing close by over $4,000 and our monthly payments by $400. I called and had the loan officer check the number, but was informed it looked correct. I pushed back again and provided the tax law credit information and FINALLY it was corrected before closing. The buyer should not have to deal with these headaches when making a major purchase.6. We were going to get a credit of $5,000 from the builders loan company. We were told very straight forward that rocket mortgage could beat that and give us $8,000. When it came down to the end I honestly don\u2019t feel were given the credit we were PROMISED and we basically felt cheated. The loan officer showed us a screenshot of how the credit is being applied and I could basically see the credit in the back end\u2026not on the closing disclosure. The closing specialist informed us of completely different numbers for the credits and I don\u2019t feel we got our credit. It honestly felt like Rocket Mortgage increased the costs somewhere else in the closing process to balance out the credit were owed so we wouldn\u2019t notice that we didn\u2019t get our full credit.

Because of this and multiple other delays, where every time members of my \"closing team\" -- a different person each time, with a different requirement for closing each time, none of whom had spoken to each other, or who gave a consistent message -- continued to contradict each other, my loan was delayed by months, when that timeframe was harmful to my personal economic plan. Thankfully, I found the error on this loan that was supposed to have been fixed the first time, before actually closing the loan, and corrected it. The gentleman who closed the loan was kind and cordial, but when I had questions about some of the documentation, there were questions he wasn't allowed to answer per company policy. There should be no limitations on what questions can be asked about a loan from the notary. If they do not know, that is one thing, but to be directed from the company, not to explain certain aspects of the loan, is unacceptable. I will not be using this company again.

This time was horrible.  It was the most confusing and aggrevating transaction ever!  We were down to the wire and told to sign off on paperwork that was inaccurate but not to worry because the final numbers would be correct.  When I said I wasn't comfortable signing off on incorrect numbers I was told it would delay closing if i didn't.  I was constantly bothered about locking in interest rates when rates were clearly coming down and I told Josh I didn't want to lock in until the last minute.  The untrained people who seemingly couldn't handle a remote closing with a power of attorney at an attorney's office and again no help from  Josh.  The ultimate was when Josh called 10 days after our closing to see how things went.  A little late by then! This whole thing was like dealing with a used car salesman - and his untrained team throughout.  Never again will I use Rocket.  I fully intend to re-fi in 2024 when the interest rates are lower and will go anywhere other than Rocket.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "my loan officer was not transparent\u2026", "text": "my loan officer was not transparent with me.

For a company that prides it self in communication this certainly is no longer your strong suit. I requested a phone call or text message if anything was needed more often than not I got an email. I explained to my banker I often don\u2019t look at my email but once a week. Although he said he would be willing to communicate with text or phone I often received an email and I didn\u2019t get notification but my husband did. I found this very frustrating. Next, your fees were a moving target.  These changed I believe 5x during our two month long very frustrating process with your company. I did understand that the fee would go up when the mortgage went up so the initial fee and one change I expected.  Our appraisal came back for more, congrats to us but then all of a sudden without notice your team tried to add an additional adjoining parcel to the mortgage even though it wasn\u2019t part of the original deal. I call this very SNEAKY and you have bad practices. The banker said oh well we included it just incase you wanted us to include. Seriously who would leverage more than what is needed.  Loss of documentation and multiple people calling for the same items. I received a complaint from my land contract holder in which they informed me of the information sent over what day they sent it and it got lost with your title company after receiving a verbal communication saying they received it. Process was not at all smooth with the title company.. I had a land contract this land contract was between the land holder and my husband and I. For some reason the title company continued to ask for paperwork on my husband company so they could prepare a deed to move title from our company to us personally. NO WHERE WAS THIS A THING but just stopped our progress. I spoke at least three times with your banker Sean saying this item shouldn\u2019t be part of this deal. My husband is a sole proprietor of a business, and we never have put land in his businesses name.  Therefore no deed should be required this wasted our time. On the day closing, the fees were increased again and at that point, I was on vacation and if it did not close on that particular day, my intention was to start the process over again with another company as not one person that I dealt with really knew what was going on. Your employees are not educated in title, customer service, and clarity.   After losing a whole day of my vacation, I think we finally closed by 8 o\u2019clock that evening wasting a whole day that I paid to be with my family and I was stuck in a room fighting with your uploading technology, getting the proper fees and overall complete chaos on your part. I will never refer anyone to your mortgage company.  I have been a previous customer and your customer service at that time was wonderful. You certainly have gone down as a company.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Lack of trust and communication", "text": "Our lending officer lacked in his communication and was not very helpful. It was my first time buying a home so I was not aware of certain terms and procedures and he seemed to have a limited knowledge himself. At moments it felt like the blind leading the blind. In the end my biggest complaint was he did not listen to what I wanted and I felt pressured to close with a loan that I was not completely happy with. I had explained how I was not interested in buying down the interest rate as I was planning on paying the mortgage back within 5 years. He proceeded to use our \u201cdiscount\u201d for using a Rocket Mortgage realtor towards buying points to lower our interest rate after I specifically said I wasn\u2019t interested in doing that. The interest rate was still at market avg and it felt like any discount we would\u2019ve gotten was wasted. We only found this out at closing and at that point we were ready to close and moved forward with this as we didn\u2019t want to go through the underwriting process again.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Not only does Rocket Mortgage call you\u2026", "text": "Not only does Rocket Mortgage call you 1 million times and send you 1000 emails and regular mail but they choose to do what they wish with your account so when you refinance and say I\u2019m wanting to pay off credit card debt and they choose what credit card debt you get to pay off And then they choose to add in a collection that is no void and then you end up with $1000 laying out there that you cannot get back.

This will be submitted to my fathers Elder Law Attorney, Eglin FCU, and through the state of Florida regarding Exploitation of the Elderly. My father is currently 95, in a nursing home, good health but memory issues. I recently (only this month!) had to take over his affairs (POA) and in reviewing his bank accts. found an automatic monthly deduction for $203 EVERY month since 4/2013 (he was 85 years old). Found 1 paper only showing a Whole Life Insurance (not Term) policy for $10k, not to expire till he is 121. I called the company to ask about this and to request policy documents etc. I was told the policy gained no cash value, no dividends or %, would payout NO MORE than $10k ever, and cash surrender value is $4k today. So, he has paid $24k over the 10 years (and continues to pay) for a policy never worth more than $10k. He was 85 when he purchased this, in great health, and no way would he have knowingly purchased something like this that would not have increased in value. NOTE: after calling company for INFO only, I went online to set the account up and view any documents. I saw payments were set to MAIL instead of AUTO deduct (as it has been for 10years). Called back, was told they don\u2019t know why or how it was changed. He does not get mail (memory care), so I asked what would have happened if they sent a statement and payment was not made\u2026was told policy would have been cancelled and NO VALUE, EVEN CASH SURRENDER! Scam\u2026somebody at the company was trying to get this policy to lapse even though they have received over $24k! Currently turned over yesterday to Elder Law atty, and contacted CU to also hold them liable for recommending this policy. Thankfully, my father can afford the fees to litigate this\u2026.I\u2019m sorry so many other people on here absolutely depend on this company to protect them financially.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Promises not held", "text": "Our privacy guidelines prohibit us from communicating specific policy details through unsecured channels like email.

He died 2 month before his policy matured. I do understand the problem there. It was unexpected because he was set to be released from the hospital. But at the same time expected because he was so old. The cause of death is clear on his death certificate, heart and kidney issues. It's only a $10,000 policy. They sent me the form that he filled out and he checked off that he suffered from everything due to his inability to normally think clearly but they still accepted him.The process;They send forms in the mail that take 14 business days to get to you. No option for emailing them and they are not located on their website. The forms are for investigation purposes. My dad clearly died from heart failure, I was by his side to see it! He was 80 years old and would have made it to 81 this March. I uploaded his death certificate as soon as I got it so they know what he died from. I received the forms and ended up spilled something on them while filling them out. I called and requested replacements. Another 14 business days go by and I dont receive the forms. I instead receive a letter from them letting me know I have not sent the forms in. Then a week later I received the forms. I fill them out and uploaded them. A while after that, I get another notice telling me that they still don't have the documents. It is 3 months later his medical bills are coming in hard and fast with no relief. I had to bury him using his life savings because this insurance company was not in my corner. I'm stressed, broke, and I will have to call again today to attempt to clear this up. This company seems to do everything in its power to prolong this process and make it as painful as possible. Why kick a beneficiary during their lowest moment, just why?I've read some of the other comments. I don't need condolences. I need them to do their ******* job and stop water boarding me through an unnecessarily lengthy process in which there probably will be no payout.

The company sent a letter stating the policies had been paid in full. Since both my parents were being paid together they figured everything was fine. Then recently my father wanted to cash in both policies. He finds out that my mom's has been cancelled and a letter had been sent to an address in Los Angeles. They NEVER lived in Los Angeles. I spoke to several different people, Melanie, Tim, a name I did not write down , and Jennie. Tim researched the issue and stated ify parents paid $176.00 they could reinstate the policy and it would be paid in full, since the letter was never sent to them. Tim then said Melanie would call on Monday to tell me where to sent the check etc. Which seemed like the correct and professional way to handle. Well, on Tuesday Jennie called and said it was my father's responsibility to know that the policy needed to be paid. I again explained to her about the letter being sent to incorrect address and policies being together.  She just said she was sorry and and that another letter was sent to the correct address, 20 years later, and nothing was done. I explained to her, the letter did not get to my parents and my father keeps extremely good records. She just ignored this and any responsibility. The policy was only $1600 pay out. I told her it was so unprofessional and karma was a b**\"\". I am reporting them to the BBB and any insurance complaint agency.   My parents are in their 90s and took this policy out in the 1970s. I cannot believe this company would not honor Mom's even though I explained exactly how they made a mistake.  Disgusting.Update: The reply from TruStage were for show. Someone phoned me. She started saying she could not find the account. I explained how the previous individuals found it and how Tim spoke to customer support and they decided it was their mistake, so my parents just had to pay the amount to reinstate the policy. She continued to say she would have to find it and look into it then call me back.  A big run around. That phone call was last week, I have yet received any phone calls. Horrible company service and very bad business.

When I contacted them they said his policy  was still active like he was still alive,that they had no information regarding  his death. I contacted  the funeral  home,they had been paid so the information  obviously  had been sent. The funeral home sent me copies of the paperwork  and I emailed it to trustage. The following  day May 14 I get a call in regards to his paperwork death benefits etc. I explain  all this had been done at the funeral  home and I had mailed it out to service Canada on the 1st of May. I have heard nothing since, it is the 24th of May and I received  nothing. There is money after his funeral  costs. I have emailed  them and I'm ignored. I've been off work (paralyzed)due to my grief and now I have to worry about bills has well. This should  not be taking so long. My father did this to make it easier  for me and it's been a heartbreaking  nightmare.Today is the 27th just spent an hour on the phone with customer service(half hour on hold) got nowhere. I would like to also add I called the funeral  home paperwork  was sent on the 29th of April  and apparently they have not been paid either. Someone  else had led me to believe  they had been paid. They are not impressed  either. Way to go guys!!!Wed June 26Still waiting!! Check was mailed apparently May 29th. Still not here. Got some attention  for my review but not results. Last week I spoke to someone who offered  to void the check which would take approximately 24-48 hours to do then they would deposit it into my account.  This was last Wed in the am so a week later still no deposit. I have sent emails once again  with no response except on Monday which was a automated reply that she was not in the office that day. The check has not shown up either beginning  to think it's just sitting on someone's desk. Still waiting for response on emails sent yesterday.I would also like to add another  issue in regards to their final documentation  service. I did not use this service  my father paid for. I was advised of a refund for that. Sent them the required information on June 5th. Called them the following  Fri to check on status of it. I was told they have received the info and someone was looking into that this very day.Called today to find out what was going on (10 days later) and the person I spoke to said she needed  to verify the information had been received. I told her the last person I talked to had already verified this. She just repeated  herself cause nothing I said mattered.

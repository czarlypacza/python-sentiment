I'm 5'2\" and bought these pants for a new job. I typically wear a 1X or 2X and used the Halara Size Guide to select the 2X size. Despite being $40 each, the pants I received were made of an extremely cheap polyester and would need to be hemmed at least four inches in order to fit me. After finding it impossible to initiate a return on the Halara website, I emailed support on 10/9/24. In response to my email, I was sent an unresponsive link to initiate a return. I then spent 25 minutes in Chat Support with a clearly overwhelmed team member who was able to eventually email me a return label despite her saying it would originally take her 24 hours to do so. On 10/11/24, I spent $4 on packaging and mailed the pants back to Halara via UPS. On the 17th, Halara Support emailed me and stated they needed a tracking number before initiating a return. I attached my UPS receipt and on the 18th they stated they initiated a refund of $89.90 to my card. It is now 10/22/24. The refund that is still processing to my account is only for $82 despite Halara support stating that the refund would include the cost of the shipping label. This also doesn't account for the $4 I spent on packaging. In total, I've wasted over $93, 25 minutes over chat, and hours on emails to wait 9 business days to MAYBE receive a partial refund.

I then spent 25 minutes in Chat Support with a clearly overwhelmed team member who was able to eventually email me a return label despite her saying it would originally take her 24 hours to do so. On 10/11/24, I spent $4 on packaging and mailed the pants back to Halara via UPS. On the 17th, Halara Support emailed me and stated they needed a tracking number before initiating a return. I attached my UPS receipt and on the 18th they stated they initiated a refund of $89.90 to my card. It is now 10/22/24. The refund that is still processing to my account is only for $82 despite Halara support stating that the refund would include the cost of the shipping label.

I chose to not pay the return shipping and instead write an honest review of each item, with photos, but they will not post them.  I would guess the positive reviews are all fake because the reviews on the items I purchased do not match my experience at all.

I\u2019m down considerable money and have two pairs of unwearable pants and a pair of leggings that are going to wear out.  Also would like to add that the shipping took a very long time and came from China.  At one point the tracking stopped, which usually means you can then track it via Canada post, but the number shows as invalid.  When the package arrived it had a whole new label put over top of the original shipping label and had a completely different tracking number.  Very sketchy practice for what is supposed to be a reputable business.

I got a refund after almost a month of the package disappearing and badgering Halara cusromer service. The courier they used, SpeedX, appears to be a scam. On the second \"attempt\" to deliver the package after it had already been missing for a month, the driver took a picture of my package outside my apartment parking lot, claimed I met them to pick it up, then they disappeared with it.  The SpeedX website has no option to talk with a representative, the phone number is not in service, and they never replied to any of my messages seeking assistance.

I will never buy from the Halara website again especially since the sizing is all different and returns are a night mare. Update: they did not send me an email with any further details.

It\u2019s just inconvenient and a waste of money if you\u2019re unsure of your size and you buy multiple items of things to what your size is then have to pay the shipping send them all back. At least as a company have consistent sizing across all items. The two items I bought were not very different. Both legging style pants in an xs. One was way too small and tight and the other was loose. It\u2019s 2025 companies have better pricing on getting shipping labels than consumers. That\u2019s a policy that is the companies choice. However as consumers beware it\u2019s a nightmare.

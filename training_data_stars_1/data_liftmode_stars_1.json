Something felt fishy with them not responding promptly and how they worded their emails. Their website states their headquarters are located in Chicago but I wonder if they are based in China.  This could be a Chinese supplement company with a facade of being an American company.  From the return policy to the faulty Chicago headquarters address, they whole vibe feels deceptive. Plus, I am unhappy with the products I received but they refuse to honor a return/refund. Yes you get an order sent to you but the legitimacy of the company and quality is overall sketchy.

I rated each interaction honestly and did not act mean or hateful to any associate.LEO saw that I had rated one of our interactions negatively, so he launched into a tirade saying I was an abusive customer. He then sent me an email saying he banned my account.I tried to call and speak to someone and got ahold of LEO. He started yelling at me over the phone saying I was an abusive customer. I asked to speak to a Manager and LEO told me \"they\" didn't have time for that or for me.I then went back to the in-website chat and started asking questions about different products and LEO came on and said I was banned and they wouldn't sell any products to me.This was all within the span of about 1.5 hours where I was a new customer and just inquiring about their products and services.Somehow it went from me chatting with them in the app, to their employee LEO yelling at me over the phone, sending me emails that he was banning me and saying I was an abusive customer. All because I asked a few questions and needed some time to do my due diligence before ordering.If they are legitimate, they sure seem to be absolutely terrible at customer service.LEO attacked me verbally and then said I was the one who was abusive to them for asking questions.THEY sell supplements that are designed to \u201cCALM\u201d people down. Maybe LEO should consider taking the same supplements he\u2019s selling on behalf of this company\u2026I'm still trying to process this, but I would steer clear of this website at all costs. They have no patience and will blow up on you if they feel you've taken too much of their time or asked too many questions before handing over your Credit Card Information.Be careful...Addendum:If you are any person reading this (other than the LiftMode clan), please do this thought experiment for me. Do you think myself as a new customer just randomly decided out of the blue to suddenly get embroiled in a battle with an obscure website I had literally only discovered a few days ago, just for my own kicks, or is it possible that what I'm saying is real and actually happened?? I did NOT just seek out to become ensnared in a battle with a website I barely even knew existed. Everything I wrote in my review ACTUALLY happened. I have NO motive to make anything up and it would be an absolute WASTE of my time to fabricate or embellish anything. Look at how much time I've spent writing this review and how intricate and detailed I've made it. I wouldn't just do that if NOTHING happened and I was just wanting to without CAUSE, slander someone (as LEO claims).LEO claims I said I would slander him online. I NEVER said anything like that. After he yelled at me over the phone and sent me emails saying he was banning me, I responded to his email saying I would write as many reviews as I could about my experience with him. Honest reviews. LEO was unhelpful, hostile, aggressive and downright mean the entire interaction. And...he wants to just parrot my claims of his treatment towards me, back saying I did the same to him. I was professional and courteous. What started WW3 for LEO was after I rated an in-app chat negatively. He went from Hot to Cold instantaneously and then abruptly became defensive, aggressive and mean and emailed immediately that he was banning me.I found another website that sold the identical product for a 1/3 of their price. That associate threw in a freebie and same day shipping, along with a deep discount code. All while being unbelievably nice to me. I'm wondering why that website was overly helpful, but LEO and company were incredibly aggressive the entire time??LEO needs to take his own supplements he peddles. Because acting like that in life, is never acceptable. I was a brand new potential customer and LEO treated me like I was trash, yelling and screaming and threatening the entire time. He is NOT innocent! He is NOT the victim here. He is and was the AGGRESSOR.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Charged me for freight when it should\u2026", "text": "Charged me for freight when it should have been free, emailed customer service with no reply.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "I haven\u2019t received yet", "text": "Date of experience: October 15, 2019", "rating": 1}, {"title": "1 or 2 capsules does nothing", "text": "1 or 2 capsules does nothing. 3 is a bad trip.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Don\u2019t buy from here", "text": "No response, you shipment.

When I went to open the tub the 'seal' which should have been intact around the lid had been cut around so the top was able to come off without breaking it.  Also, the actual seal to get at the product was missing.  I've been purchasing phenibut since 2007 from various sources and it's ALWAYS sealed. I called into their 'customer service' line quite upset and was told to take photos and send them in, which I did.  I will not lie.  I was escalated as that's a lot of money for me to spend on a supplement.   After this all 'customer service' ended with them and they avoided all my future contacts with them. I mean, they responded to me but wouldn't do anything.  For instance, I'd request a return label and they're reply with an email telling me they've sent me an email but there wouldn't be a return label attached, they'd say it might be in my junk mail, etc. One of my many calls into the call center were returned with someone leaving me a voicemail of them asking why I was calling?!  It was obvious by Saturday that they were playing a game with me and I told them I wasn't going to be ripped off.  Well, that got a reaction.  The chord was struck and they seemed to ramp up the passive aggressive behavior of returning my emails with \"We're going to close this incident case since it appears to have been resolved\" when nothing had been done.  So I'm out over $150.  I will not use this product as it's been opened.  Part of me is considering sending it back on my own dime but I'm afraid they'll claim non-receipt of the product and I'll be completely out of everything.  I'm hoping the owner or an investor in this company sees this and inquires into my experience.  It's horrible customer service.  If they did a bit of research on my past they'd see I had a good history.  A package they sent me got lost in the mail, they had to reship a package to me.  After a couple of weeks the first package they sent to me arrived, I got a return label from them and shipped it back.    It really is puzzling to me.

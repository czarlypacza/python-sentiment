Well, you will have to take a picture of your ID/passport and send it via email or upload it to a website. Another option they give you is to reply with your personal information (ID, place of bith, address, phone number, etc.) to an email they'll send you. Not safe.

After I did the transaction in person I received an email stating that my transaction was \"under review\". 24 hrs. later, it was still under review.

To top it off, if you call, no one will transfer you with a supervisor, you will get a representative that has been trained to say \"I am really sorry that this happemed to you, I understand...\" and will tell you to send your ID digitally or wait 24 hrs. After 24 hrs. of silence, you will call again and then, they will tell you that they will send an email to escalate your case to the next office and that they will take 7 working days or so to review your case and come up with the resolution.

This last attempt to send money to a relative that I have sent money to several times before was a disaster and after a few days of WU unnecessarily wasting my time I ended up telling them to cancel the transfer and refund my money. I tried sending a few hundred dollars to my brother in-law overseas as I had done several times before but this time I immediately got an email from WU saying they suspected I have been a victim of fraud and to contact them to verify it was me that was sending the money. I was suspicious of the email and ignore it as I thought it was some sort of phishing scam. There was no reason for WU to need this since I have made several identical transactions before and both WU and my credit card required 2 factor verification which both were completed when doing the transaction. And why email me when they have my phone number. If they wanted to verify it was me then just call me as credit card companies do but no -  over the next 3 days I was spammed with no less than 90-100 of the same email message saying the transaction was on hold until I called them. Finally, in order to stop the email spamming, I called. The customer service (if you can call it that) person again said WU suspected I had been the victim of fraud and wanted to verify it was me. I asked why they thought the transaction was fraud since it's the same transaction I had made to the same person several times before. I didn't get an answer. After asking again for the third time the customer service person said they weren't allowed to give out that information. Hmmmm. I asked why the same transaction I have made before was being questioned and was told they don't look at transaction history but only look at each individual transaction and assess just that one. Okay, If you're going to BS a customer, you need to come up with a yarn that at least make a lick of sense. That's exactly the go-to method that all credit card companies use - you're usage history. If you've made similar purchases at the same vendor, they don't question it's validity. Never mind that, again, that I completed 2 factor verification for both WU and the credit card I used. I was then asked for the last 3 digits of my driver's license which I provided, then I was as if my brother in-law asked me for the money which I answered no and that my wife asked me to send it to him. I was then asked repeatedly if I verified with my brother in-law if he asked for the money I repeatedly said no that my wife requested I send it. I was also asked what was it for and I answered that his daughter needed medical attention and I was sending it to help but in fact that is none of their business to begin with. It was only $500...REALLY!! So if I wanted to send a surprise birthday gift to someone overseas, I have to verify the surprise with them first???? Really!!! By that time I'm thoroughly agitated and strongly suspecting their up to some scam. I told them to cancel the transaction and refund my money and I'll use another service. The customer service person offered to transfer me to a manager but what for? More of the same BS. I said no and hung up. I wondered what knuckle head in WU management thought up of this scheme. Did he wake up one morning and asked himself \"Hmmm, what can I do to thoroughly anger our customers so they won't do business with us ever again??? Wait! I know...!\" I suspect WU is trying to do what the banks do when they put you're cheque deposit on hold. The longer they can hold on to you're money, the less they have to borrow and pay interest on to handle their daily cash flow needs. The banks use the excuse that they need 5 days to make sure you're deposit clears from the bank the cheque is drawn on which is also BS since everything these days is transacted electronically and the funds clear the drawn account the same day. so why the 5 day hold?? Now you know. I suspect WU is pulling the same ruse trying to hold onto my money for as long as possible but they can't use the \"need to wait for funds to clear\" excuse so they have to come up with some other lame-brained excuse which this \"suspected fraud\" BS excuse is what they seem to have settled on. They've had my money for 3 days now and I really don't know how long they intended to play their game until they let the funds go, if ever, but I wasn't going to find out. As it is, they now claim the bank will take 5-7 days to process my refund which is more BS. If they process the refund immediately, it would be posted back to my CC account the next day as all my refunds are from other vendors are but remember, that's not what their game is about.

In the event I asked for the supervisor, CS put me on hold for 20 mins. After 20 mins on hold I was able to talk to Zara the supervisor. Upon talking to Zara about the incident. As what she claimed that there was an option in the process for me to choose 1.99 CAD fee discount or 300WU reward/12CAD discount, which didn't make sense from the start I choose to use my 300WU reward.I had a feeling she had no clue to what she was talking about.So I challenge ZARA the supervisor that I will do another remittance and redeem 100WU reward/ 3.00CAD discount. Over the phone Zara and I did a step by step on how it should be done on the app. To my surprise, there wasn't any option whether to choose rewards or fee. The system just outright discounted the 1.99CAD fee and still NO 3.00CAD discount/100WU rewards applied. She ZARA claimed I got my $2 discount which I guess she's implying to the $1.99 fee and told me I lost my other $1. So regardless of what you redeem on your Western Union 100WU reward/3CAD or 300WU reward/12CAD discount you will still only get a discount of $1.99 fee.

I use this service to send money to my myself and to my spouse in Argentina. We use this money to pay for our rent, groceries, and other necessities. I make a transfer once or twice a month, depending on my paychecks. We rely on this service.I have been a loyal customer of Western Union for probably 3 years at this point and I can say that the quality of the service has gone down significantly in the past year and a half. When I joined, there were always discounts on transfer fees and a great reward system. At one point, they stopped offering the reward system, claiming that they are working on the service. The rewards system has been unavailable for probably over a year at this point. Additionally, I haven't been able to apply any discount codes to waive my transfer fees in a long time. When I try to use a $15 off discount code, the transfer fails to go through, it won't even load the next page after I choose my payment options. When I remove the code, my transfer goes through with no problem. On top of all of this, they continue to raise the transfer fees.When I spoke to a customer service representative about this happening, he told me to try restarting my computer to fix the problem... Like the issue was my fault, not Western Union's. I have talked to multiple customer service representatives and they have all been terrible and unhelpful.

While waiting, I noticed that the employee assisting the person ahead of me provided them with a receipt. When it was my turn, however, I was not given a receipt. Although I found this strange, I was eager to leave with my 40,000 Lira (or so I thought), so I didn't press the issue.The cash was sealed in plastic packaging, which I didn't open until I arrived in Turkey. To my dismay, I discovered that I was missing 10,000 Lira, equivalent to \u00a3200. It's clear to me now that the employee exploited the situation, knowing that I wouldn't count the cash in a busy and potentially unsafe environment, and that I would quickly place it in my bag.I realize that I bear some responsibility for not verifying the amount on the spot. However, the absence of a receipt was likely intentional, making it impossible for me to take any corrective action.I have been a regular customer at this branch, frequently exchanging money to Euros. Because the amounts were smaller, I always counted the cash and it was always correct. This time, with a larger amount, I didn't count it on the spot, and it feels like the employee knew I wouldn't. I understand that I won't recover my money, but i believe there\u2019s a CCTV system in place so if there\u2019s an investigation at least this will be stopped immediately.

When it wasn't delivered on June 25, I called Western Union on June 26 to check and see why it wasn't there. The W.U. rep informed me that day that receiving banks can take some time to process the funds and don't always release the funds the day W.U. send them. This was a difficult conversation due to a light language barrier, which would have been fine except there was a large amount of noise from the very busy call center around the rep I was speaking to. She gave me a confirmation # for the bank transaction to help the receiver's bank track it down. I called the receiver and he checked with his bank, who said they had no record of that confirmation #. I gave an extra 2 days for the funds to hopefully become available, but when June 28th came and the bank was still telling the receiver there was no deposit, I called W.U. again to check. The person I spoke with proceeded to go through almost the exact same explanation the one I spoke with on June 26 did, even though a significantly longer amount of time had passed. I asked him if I could cancel the transaction and he said yes, but asked that I give it one more day before canceling because he had \"new information\" saying that it should be ready on June 27 to June 28. He said several times that the funds should be available in just a few hours. He convinced me to not cancel the transaction or escalate to an investigative team. Saturday, June 29 came and, of course, no deposit. I called again and the person I spoke with this time said it was impossible to retract/cancel the transaction (different from the June 28 guy, who I think was just trying to get me off the phone). He said the only thing he could do was escalate to another team. After escalating and giving me that confirmation #, I had a couple of other questions, but the rep said he could no longer discuss my questions with me because the case had already been escalated. Now I'm waiting to hear from the escalation team, who was supposed to contact me yesterday. I'm not confident they will contact me (they're already a day late) so I'm going to have to call again and go through the whole run-around routine again to get to someone that can talk to me about the escalation.

While I was checking my Instagram, I happen to see a Saudi Princess who is helping the people who were affected by covid, so I contacted her & she promised to send me some money. She gave me a contact number in Jordan & asked me to contact them and they will inform me about the steps of collecting the monetary amount.I contacted them & they asked me to transfer 1,750 AED in order to authorize someone to collect the amount from Jordan Central Bank.On September 8, 2020 I transferred the amount of 1,750 AED from Al Ansari Exchange in City Life Al Tallah, Ajman. The amount was sent to a person who I found out later that she belongs to a group of scammers.After sending them this amount, they asked me to send them another 2,000 AED. I felt something is wrong, so I asked one of my Jordanian friends to go & check if this company exists in Amman as they have informed me about their address. After few hours, I came to know that this is a fraudulent case & the company that I am dealing with in Jordan does not exist.I contacted Al Ansari immediately & requested their help to stop this transaction & reverse it, but they could not do anything as the remmittance was already collected. They just advised me to report it to Western Union.After reporting the above, I was surprized that Western Union have blocked me from using their services again. Despite several follow up with them, nobody was able to sort out my case. This proved to me that Western Union supports scammers & whoever reports scams will definitely be blacklisted and will never be able to use their services again.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Site crashes throughout process of\u2026", "text": "Site crashes throughout process of submitting transfer request, very frustrating ", "rating": 1}, {"title": "my money transfer keeps on refunding\u2026", "text": "my money transfer keeps on refunding with my debit card and it does not go through I called CSR not helpful and does not even want to check my details", "rating": 1}, {"title": "to many questions on the phone number\u2026", "text": "to many questions on the phone number still didn't get the money sent and spent too much wasted time on the phone", "rating": 1}, {"title": "I had the worst experience when I need to transfer money during emergency.\ud83d\udea8 ", "text": "I prefer some other platforms instead of WesternUnion.

I completed the transfer and thought the user experience was quite smooth. I received the tracking number which I shared with the recipient in Lebanon.When I checked my inbox to view the transfer confirmation, I found an email mentioning that my bank declined the transfer, so I made the transfer using a different payment method and shared the new tracking details with the recipient.The following day, the recipient confirmed that the first transfer was successful and they collected the money using the first tracking code and told me to request a refund for the second transfer.I went on the Western Union app to request a refund only to see that the transfer is on hold and I was informed that the transfer is under review by the compliance team who revealed that the name of the recipient is on a suspicious list and they cannot release the money until they complete the compliance check. Mind you that the first transfer was made to the exact same person and that was not suspicious.I have been in touch with customer service and the compliance team via email and via telephone to process a refund. They all have a set of responses they copy/paste to every email, almost feels like I am handled by a bot. It is impossible to get a human response. It's now been almost 7 weeks and I still have not received the refund or any human interaction. It seems the compliance check was completed as the status of the transfer changed from 'on hold' to 'completed'. However, when I check the status of the transfer using the tracking number, it shows that it has been collected by the recipient which is not true at all.

After 4 days of processing, receiver was unable to pick up the money because Western Union's agent in Saudi Arabia stated that there was a \"space\" before the country in his entry in the computer. Of note, country is selected via drop down menu and not manually typed when sending money. Contacted customer support via phone and they could not see the issue and stated over and over that the transfer was good. They suggested 1. To try picking up the money at another location (there is no other location that allows picking up near the recipient) 2. To try picking up the money again at the same agent (attempted twice). 3. To cancel the transfer (which still doesn't solve the issue). After the recipient tried to pick up the money again, contacted customer support via live chat, and in the 1 hour plus conversation, all the same as the above were stated with me having to repeatly explain the situations multiple times (ie. Why the recipient cannot just go to another WU agent that doesn't exist in her area). Overall, both assisting customer support agents don't seem to have any idea what the error on the receiving agent's end is despite explaining that it was an error in their system that added a space before the country name. Both agents stated they did not have access to the info to resolve the situation but are unable to forward to anyone who does. So now my money is in the nowhere in a different country and despite both me and my recipient both talking to Western Union agents at the same time, they are refusing to release the money.Of note: the recipient had been able to pick up money previously with no issues on a prior occasion.", "rating": 1}]

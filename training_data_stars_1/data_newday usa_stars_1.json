I will be looking to refinance through someone else and will never do anything with this company again. So we closed on our loan, and they had told me to make it right they were going to cut some fees (emails to prove that.) They contacted and told me that they were able to cut some fees and some get me the amount that I had originally signed. So we closed and unfortunately for me I should\u2019ve paid better attention because instead of me getting an escrow refund they rolled it over, so they really didn\u2019t cut any fees they just shorted me about $1000 in a different place. The ethics of this place are laughable and when the streamline comes back I\u2019ll be taking my mortgage somewhere else.Worked with Tom from NewDay on my refinance and the oversold me on how much my home was worth so it ended up being like 35k less. Wasn\u2019t interested in continuing with them but with what they were gonna offer I figured we could make it work. Closing day comes and the numbers don\u2019t match what I signed on the CD.

The Title company did not get an attorney to my closing, and took 2 business days later to finally get one so I could close. Even then, the seller was not getting paid the day of closing and thus he was not letting me have the house. He was calling New Day USA and me. I called the title co. and finally talked with the NewDay Director of Loan Processing. He fixed it and said it was an IT mistake. In other words, I was doing the job of New Day so the seller could get paid and I could get my house. I've closed on several properties. This was the most difficult, frustrating, upsetting process/closing I've experienced compared to the several properties I've bought and sold, What I've written is only a portion of what occurred.

Egregious, considering I have experience with purchasing a home and refinancing in the past. The loan officer took no responsibility and blamed the software when she inserted the figures herself after I provided facts and figures from documentation I had. After that, I was told I would receive a welcome package welcoming me and providing information on submitting payments and online portal information. That welcome package never came. I had to call to request it be sent out. I was also shorted escrow refund which NewDay is looking into. I had to call NewDay to get a link emailed to me so I can set up and access my account online, it's sad I had to do that. When I was able to set up my account online, I could not submit my first payment online. I then had to call NewDay again to ask why I couldn't. I was informed by NewDay that I needed to sign a payment authorization form. NewDay rep confirmed the form was never sent to me, so they initiated it to be sent. That form was not included in my first statement that was sent to me.

My sister lost her job (while pregnant) during COVID and she came to stay with me (different state) while my brother-in-law stayed there to keep working as a Sheriff.  I picked up a lot of the family's day-to-day costs, allowing minimum for him as they are a two household family.  As a result, I needed a forbearance because I went from a house of one to a house of five.  My brother-in-law is also a Marine veteran.  I did a covid forbearance, ended it when my sister was rehired by the company as things began to ease up.  I rolled the missed payments into my loan under a COVID modification last year.  Today, looking to do a cash out refinance, I was told I could NOT be serviced because I've had a modification in the past two years.  I advised that the VA's policy is that you must wait 210 days, and I'm well past that and was told I still could not be serviced.  I explained the situation and my brother being a veteran as well (because he spoke over and over about the commitment to vets and the Admiral's mission for vets).  I was told, I could not be helped because of this.  I asked why wasn't this upfront BEFORE running my credit and taking all of my information \"on a recorded line\".  I was advised because we can't pre-screen for everyone/everything.  SURELY when in the past two years we've had a pandemic and MANY people have unfortunately yet (blessed) utilized a covid forbearance, you would ask this question upfront if you cannot provide me service. I'm trying to understand how knowing the this, knowing many vets would fall into this category, knowing the VA makes you only wait 10 days, would you still not service anyone.  But hey, company's have a right to run their business and assess the risks as they see fit - fair enough.  But to collect my data and run my credit, and NOT let me know this upfront is unfair. I also \"personally\" find it unfortunate that you don't support people in my situation.  Every company isn't for everyone but this country went through something collectively and thank goodness my family made it out.  Kind of hard to say you are a number one supporter of veterans but yet won't service anyone with a modification in the past two years when the VA's own guidance says you have to only wait 210 days. My recommendation - be fair with your practices UPFRONT.  The same way you asked me all of those prescreening questions about prior foreclosures, delinquent federal debt, etc. - ask me about that BEFORE you cause a hit on my credit report and get all of my personal and pertinent details.  I worked with a gentleman named Benjamin Taylor who is the \"Vice President\" of Loan Origination #905190. To ensure this is not a discriminatory practice, I reached out to Mr. Taylor and Corporate and requested a copy of the written policy.

Rather, it is another mortgage company owned by PHH that preys upon Vets and uses the DOD\u2019s resources (including imposing cost on the member\u2019s command) to take advantage of service members while claiming to be the best option for military.  It is also not the cheapest option for Veterans. In short, the customer service was poor, their fees were high (they did not give me the free appraisal they advertise on television) and they offered numerous, laughable moments of incompetence.I could write a Stephen King length novel detailing my bad experience with New Day, but here are a few stories that sum it up in microcosm:One particular employee made seven individual requests for documents instead of doing what other mortgage companies do which is give you a list upfront. What's more, they refused to accept documents from SNIP IT Tool or from a scanning app, forcing me to find an actual PDF scanner while I was oversees. In terms of imposing cost on the command, they do not have a paralegal and rely on the title companies for the service. Because their requirements are so specific, the title company could not comply with New Day USA's demands for a Power of Attorney (which are stricter than any other mortgage company I've ever used, a claim repeated by the title company). New Day USA suggested I use my command's JAG. Big mistake. The New Day employee engaged my command paralegal in a 19 email back and forth and endangered my standing at work. In the end, I still paid someone a paralegal fee (plus an appraisal fee which was supposed to be free). Furthermore, their closing costs and interest rates were pretty average during the start of the COVID crisis.  I had at least one vendor offer a better deal with fewer closing costs or money put toward them. I stuck with New Day because I was overseas and trying to buy a house INCONUS during COVID. Again, big mistake.Last, at the 11th hour, two days before closing, the same employee informs me that he moved by closing up a day and that I need to call USAA to change all of the insurance policies I purchased. Again, this would take an hour on the phone at least and invovled calling the states from an overseas line, and it occurred at 2300 my time in Europe. When I called USAA, they claimed the employee said the policy change was not related to his attempt to move my closing day and that I had authorized it. I had not, and hadn't talked to the employee in days. I bluntly told them that my closing day would not change and that if they required different dates, they should have told me sooner than 2300 at night the day of. What's more, they called my POA rep up and had her drive an hour to their office, unscheduled and during the height of COVID.Last, even though they sold my mortgage to another company two months after I moved in, they still send me bills........One employee, a VP, was helpful; she apologized for the incompetence and threw $1,000 toward our closing costs. Dealing with her was the only good part of our experience, but when I didn't' deal with her directly, incompetence from her team took the reins.If you're a Vet, think hard before you buy what this company is selling. Many vendors deal with VA loans, New Day USA is another group taking advantage of us. Also watch their offers for Re Fi, many costs come with this.

If we said no, no should have been accepted and we move on. The process took so long that my husband had to verify his employment three times. He works for the government, we had submitted our bank statements (three times). You could tell he was being paid by looking at the bank statements. And why did we have to submit our statements three times? When we finally, had our closing, we didn't get to complete it because the seller was informed they needed money for us to close. This should not have been the case. We said many times that we were paying all fees and costs. When I questioned our originator as to why we did not know there would be money needed from the seller at closing, I was informed that she represented me, the buyer, not the seller. However, because she didn't go over the paperwork and inform us, her customer was unable to complete the sale.  It was at that point that the case was taken over by someone else and we were able to close. I do not feel like my veteran was treated with respect. Your advertisement speaks of an easy process for vets. This was not easy. It was frustrating and I\"m still not sure it was done correctly because the asking price of the house was 2,000 more than the pay off and the sellers didn't receive the difference. This was a terrible experience and I would not recommend NewDay USA to anyone. However, thank goodness for Matthew Russel for taking over the case and getting things done.

We signed. We called people many times over.    We were interrogated about our credit report by the loan rep with far too many questions. The so-called \"interviews\" were far too personal and seemed to go on for weeks, even with all the information at hand for the rep (from the home we bought just 2 years ago).       The closings costs were almost double another home we just sold a year ago. The escrow had to be paid 1 year ahead of time. We just got another notice that the escrow amount had been raised yet again. We have had the loan for 3 months.    We didn't received our checks to creditors right away (or even a few days later or a week later). We told the rep. that we now had to leave to go to a funeral. I held all mail at the post office. Upon our return, the pay off checks were found (several weeks later) under the sprinkler system. They must have gotten here the week we told the rep we would be gone, and were totally ruined. Hasn't anyone at New Day heard of signed mail receipts or electronic transfer? Then, we were promised that the checks were in the mail again and not to bother about paying the monthly fees. The rep would personally talk to the card companies about it, or help us out.   '    We finally received the payoffs almost two months after closing. Meanwhile, the rep kept saying that the checks should be there and don't worry about paying the monthly fees. He would personally talk to the card companies about it. So, we didn't pay, thinking the checks would be here very soon and the promise that the rep was taking care of it.     When we talked to the rep later about this, he said he had conversations recorded exactly as to what had been said. Like we didn't know what had been said? So, this was an attempt at intimidation. The rep basically shut us up about our view or interpretation as to what happened. If I knew that he was not helping us, out as he said, we would of paid the very small fees.     Finally, about 2 months later, the checks arrived. Some were grossly misspelled.    Also as a veteran, I am not supposed to pay home taxes in the state of Arkansas. We said this over and over to the rep. We were told this would be cleared up by the rep and not to pay this home tax fee.   Then, guess what? We get called by New Day at least 5 times, saying that we needed to pay the $90.00 home tax fee and .....that we were late for the home tax fee.   We had had several late payments and one credit card account, that we had for 9 years, closed permanently (for being late 2 times and for falling credit scores).    We had to do the leg work again, and call the county to clear up the home tax situation. Nothing had been done by New Day in this regard as promised.     Nothing was smooth or easy about this loan. Everything was a dilemma. These promises to help us were not kept. Once we signed the paperwork, little did we know, we were on our own.

This is my 3rd refinance in my life and I know they take only 3 weeks to accomplish, but with Newday USA it took over 2 months. They also added $3,100 unnecessarily to the loan because they were too lazy to get the correct payoff from my other mortgage company. They harassed me every day for documentation the entire 2 months dragging out the process instead of simply asking me for it all up front.They asked me for an estimate on property taxes for the escrow account, so I gave them a letter from the property tax office with a near exact estimate of $1,304, then I had to fight with them for a month to use that number instead of an amount that was 80% less to determine my monthly mortgage payment. Probably to make their stats look better.When it came time to do the final signature I was given the name of a notary who was supposed to meet with me and the name I was given was the actual CEO of the NewDay USA Title Company 800 miles away, yeah that was an embarrassing call. As for the notary public, she called to confirm the appointment with me 1 hr 12 minutes before my appointment instead of a week earlier. I had no idea if I was going to meet with her or not until then because NewDay USA didn't keep any other deadlines throughout the entire process.Don't even think about the equity loan because they screw you by adding 1+% to the 30 year loan. In the long run as an example your $25K loan ends up to be around $100K, don't do it stick with a bank for small loans.I recommend anyone else over these clowns.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Good experience", "text": "Knowledgable people.

Loche", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Clumsy and inefficient", "text": "I regret that my feedback is so negative.  I stayed very frustrated about working with New Day. To start with, I could not get any cost estimates even though such estimates are widely available with other lenders. I'm told that New Day's ridiculous requirements for information and documentation were because this was a VA loan, which might be accurate.  But it is not the VA's fault that the New Day employees working on my loan were inefficient, did not communicate well together internally, did not consider anything in advance, and continually dropped one last minute requirement after another on us.  We were especially surprised when they called inspectors and repair people that we had engaged to ask these vendors to verify that we had paid for the services. Why didn't New Day just ask us for receipts or bank records? This was totally invasive and made our vendors think New Day was ridiculous and rinky-dink.  It took six months to close on our purchase.  I will never use them again.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Matt was outstanding.", "text": "The process was efficient and easily done", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Poor Experience", "text": "It has been a terrible experience due to the fact of a huge lack of constant communication from day one. Examples: 1. Sending us package of papers that we didn't even know what to do with them without explanation. 2. Kept questioning the fact if I was an exempt as a disabled Veteran when I clearly explained that I was. 3. Had to keep calling to find out what stage are we in through the process when that's not my job to do. 4. Didn't inform us when he was out of the office number of days so we had to call again just to find out we are in more of  a delay on your behalf not ours. 5. Finally signed our paper on the 11th of July and received our closing money direct deposit on Friday but nobody had no idea of who the carrier is that is delivery us the remainder of our checks to be paid to the creditors. Again, we had to call and chase for that information. I am glad that this is finally over but will not recommend another fellow veteran to go through this same process that went through.", "rating": 1}]

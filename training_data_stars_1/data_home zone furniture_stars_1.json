We were given the financing options and told that if we didn't want to pay interest they had a 90 day no interest option.

We were told that the payments would be every 2 weeks UNLESS we called when we took delivery and changed it to the 90 days.  Any other time we have used this option, no payments had to be made until the 90 days and then if you couldn't pay in full the payments would begin and you paid a lot of interest.  So when he used the phrase UNLESS YOU CHANGE IT, that's how it was represented to mean, no payments for 90 days.  I called to change it and was told just the opposite.  The bi-weekly payments would double to pay it off in 90 days.  I was then told \"we can come pick it up\".  I didn't want to dip that deep into my savings but was pretty much forced to.  Also, they don't tell you it's a rental agreement.  So when you use their 3rd party financing, it's just like going to Rent-a-Center and it ends up costing you double if you don't pay in full.

I visited the store a handful of times, got measurements, moved furniture around, matched with pillows, etc to be sure about my purchase since there are no refunds so imagine my disappointment when the color wasn\u2019t even close.(I have pictures)  The manager of the RR store did an excellent job of helping me exchange  (keep in mind I didn\u2019t care for any other furniture in the store but had no choice with the no refund policy). I decided on the City Limits Fabric sofa after reading the description which says in part, and I quote (copied directly from the website) \u201c Our new patent-pending technology combines down and feather seating with memory foam support for maximum comfort with rapid recovery so the cushions keep their shape. \u201d After less than a month of very little use ( only sat on by me & that wasnt often bcs I work all day) the cushions started to sag, did not recover, & did not keep their shape).. When I\u2019d had enough I hesitantly called the store (hesitant bcs I\u2019m not the complaining customer, and didn\u2019t want to seem troublesome). I was told since I\u2019d had the sofa 5 months I would have to file a claim. I filed the claim, cancelled another important appointment to be home in the window of time I was given just to have the tech come out and flip the cushion inside the sofa. I was then told that nothing can be done, I would always have to manually recover & reshape the cushions after use (unzip the cover, remove the filling & flip it) because of the down filling. I have never owned a sofa that requires you to reshape the cushions by hand everytime you sit on it. The description is very misleading and the warranty was a complete waste of time.

The material of the back cushions have significant noticeable gapping (3of6 backs). Still being within our year warranty period, we contacted customer service regarding a few cushion replacements (sent pics) however they denied our claim stating it was normal wear and tear (We\u2019re talking 10-11months of wear for two people 3 pieces of furniture).

Once again I called the store and I reported that they had sent the wrong model of couches. Again the sales rep told me that I had put in the wrong order. I told him that that is impossible because I came into the store and he had put the order into the computer and I simply paid with my credit card. This was not an online order where I was putting in my own purchase. After back and forth calls in which I continuously had to initiate the call, it was actually a customer care associate that put in the correct order. The store also set up a second delivery date without asking me during a time that I was away on holidays. I had to once again call the customer care associate and have her override the store dates.

(I find that interesting since I was told there was 2 before). She stated she found a brand-new pair of side drawer rails for me, still in box. She scheduled the tech to come see me (3 weeks out). Which means, I have to take more time off of work. HomeZone just keeps costing me money every time we interact. I find this quite interesting. I was told there were no more side rails hence why I had to receive used/display ones from the local store. How, after she digs into things, she was able to find me new parts (just the rails but still) but no one else could and in fact, I almost did not get any sets until I threw a fit. This is all very sketch and unprofessional. Regardless, I will have to deal with warped drawers that I paid at full price for new set. I also paid for new side rails but got display rails because it was that or nothing. Just not getting better with HomeZone. Original issue: The local store manager is aware of the issue, but I wanted to make sure to note my complete dissatisfaction with HomeZone. I have personally worked sales for many years. I am a district manager for a retailer, so I completely understand both sides of the spectrum. I have wanted a particular bed frame for quite some time. Unfortunately, before I could purchase it last year, it was went discontinued. I decided to stop in last Saturday to see if it was brought back or any info. I was greeted immediately with a new, young associate who was able to help me. He pulled up the item I wanted and stated there was two in stock. I clarified with him 3 separate times that it was back in stock. He stated it was and I could have it delivered in 4 days. Great. We ordered and set the delivery date as Wednesday. I had to get rid of my current bed immediately because HomeZone will not touch your old furniture. Tuesday, I sold my bed. At 1:19pm, I received a confirmation text stating 3 out of my 5 items are delivery the next day. The headboard, foot board and foot board drawers but no rails to connect them. I called the number and the lady said she would have to investigate but she believes the items to be out of stock. She called me back to let me know the rails were discontinued and to contact the store. I was hot. I now have no bed to sleep on considering I just sold it. I contacted the store manager. He informed me that the guy who helped me was still very new and didn't know what he was doing. (Unacceptable. Do not blame an associate for being \"new\". It is the job of the manager. He is only as strong as his weakest associate.) He apologized and stated he \"happened\" to have the rails in the warehouse. The problem was getting them delivered. He was going to load the parts on the truck but the lady on the phone deleted my appointment time for the next day (Why would you cancel someone's appointment before knowing the resolution?!). He called me back to let me know that he could get me in on Friday. So, now I will have sleep on the couch an extra 2 more nights (minimum) and possibly not get my bed. Not to mention, I took 2 days off of work for this now, the original date and the new date (who is paying me for this?). The bed arrives Friday. They put it together. The drawers are lop sided but what am I to do? I can't get them replaced. I can get a new set but I don't want any others. So, now I get to suffer with bed defects because this is the bed I want. I lost 2 days of pay for this. And I have a terrible experience. I will not be returning to HomeZone or ever purchasing from there again.It was a horrible experience and I have a damaged bed to show for it.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "CRAPPY TABLE", "text": "This will be the 4th time you are coming out with a table top for my new table and the 1st had a broken leg. when they came the 2nd with the new base only one of my table leafs would fit. 3rd time they came with a new top it has a bubble in the top and again only only one of the two leafs will fit in my table.

Buyer Beware!!", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Homezone Mesquite", "text": "Since there is no H.R. department looking out for the best interest of the sales associates, hopefully  this review will help address that issue and the lack of leadership at the store manager level and even the regional level. The toxic environment at Homezone Furniture in Mesquite is clearly the result of Chris Cooper\u2019s micromanaging, biased and even sexist behavior to name a few. Chris Cooper has even gone as far as to speak behind his sales representatives backs and speaks poorly of them with fellow manager Robert of Burleson referring to them as \u201cdouchebags\u201d for being only seconds late lacking moral courage to confront anyone face to face, Actions and words unbecoming of managers that should set the example and not gossip and spread rumors like Chris Cooper and Robert are known to do. As long as you don\u2019t inconvenience Chris Cooper during working hours and say yes sir no sir while he is swiping left and right on Tinder and Bumble dating apps you\u2019re on his good side. I don\u2019t know about you but I thought this was a furniture store selling furniture for the hard working American not Chris Cooper\u2019s personal time but if you can provide a suitable girlfriend for Chris Cooper in exchange for furniture that he is willing to buy for you then you are also on his good side just ask the sales associates still working there. I don\u2019t think anyone of them would be willing to allow someone they know to date such a low value individual and simp. Growing up no one ever taught Chris Cooper how to become a man that explains it in his lack of masculinity towards other male associates, his sexist behavior towards other males and only hiring women because of his shortcomings as a man in his personal life, bringing stress and frustration into the workplace affecting the rest of the sales staff with his emotional behavior. Last but not least is the despicable behavior towards Oneil Whyte one of the hardest working people I have ever met, Chris Cooper singles out this young man on a daily basis. Who knows why, maybe because of the color of his skin or because he feels threatened and jealous which are common Chris Cooper traits, you should judge a man not by his skin color but the content of his character these are tough times we are in for Chris Cooper to be showing such childish behavior. Picking and choosing when things are inappropriate or \u201cred poster\u201d making up the rules of the store as he goes. You are never allowed to call in sick according to him because you hurt the team are his words but only chooses who to enforce the standards upon showing once again biased behavior and unfair treatment. I myself only ever called in sick once this year but wasn\u2019t allowed to be ill,knowing full well COVID 19 could of been present in the store which consequently shut down for a day for COVID 19 because another associate was ill. I guess selling furniture was more important than the well being and health of the staff which are grounds for a lawsuit. Fair warning to anyone choosing to work at the Mesquite location as drama follows Chris Cooper but do not stand your ground for he will certainly shed tears for not being included since it\u2019s a place of business and not a place to make friends. Let\u2019s hope these issues are dealt with swiftly so no other future associate has to deal with this.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Delivery personnel were wearing in\u2026", "text": "Delivery personnel were wearing in appropriate political attire.

We voiced our concerns and the sales lady asked another associate and they reassured us that it would work.  We left and came back the next day asking again to be reassured but thinking all along if it doesnt work we can just return it and find something that would work though it would be a hassle but again the assosiates reassured us that it would work.  On the second day in the store we purchased the bed, over a $3,000 purchase.  All but 1200 in cash.  We pick it up the following Saturday, assemble the bed which sat up tall enough that we had to have a step stool to get on the bed.  My husband has heart trouble, he could not get on the bed so he had to sleep on the couch.  First thing the next day called spoke with a manager and was told at that point sorry, we have a no return policy.  I get out my paperwork and sure enough in tiny print at the bottom of this paperwork it said no returns. This paperwork which was not given to me until the purchase was done and I was heading out the door. NEVER during this purchase was I told NO RETURNS. The manager did say he would send an email to the corporate office to see if they would make an exception. Told him just the bedframe and would be ok with buying another from them that would work.    Gave it a couple days before I called back.  I have yet to hear from him or anybody and I have called several times and have even gone in to the store but Im told Ill need to talk to him and hes never available.

Absolutely horrendous customer service. Our first sales person (Liz) did not possess any initiative. We had to ask her several times about availability of a piece and After receiving the piece and calling, Liz notified us to have it returned and a refund would be given. After several attempts at calling (always to voicemail that wasn\u2019t set up) we went to NRH location. We were told several conflicting things about inability to refund there or exchange. Finally, we were told we could do exchange there, only to spend wasted time looking for something, and hen being told we would have to go to original location. Store manager Milo called Robert and talked about the situation. Robert wasn\u2019t even aware of why the furniture was returned because Liz apparently continued her lack of proactively communicating. We were told we had to go from North Richland Hills to S. Arlington after all.  When arriving at S Arlington, the manager Robert who was just speaking to Milo less than 20min ago had left the store. Pricila calls him and tells the situation and we were instructed we would have to come back the following day to complete exchange. Pricila states she is not authorized to exchange or refund and Manager wasn\u2019t present. She hen states she was not authorized to do so because merchandise was in the store. As if I had to have had merchandise at my house in order for a refund. When asked to speak to Robert she replied he is at home. I asked her to call him back since she clearly just spoke to him at home. I demanded my refund because of lack of professionalism, consistency, HZ not being on the same page across stores.

I'm writing to express my dissatisfaction with what happened during my time at your store. After receiving a quote from one of your managers. I was so pleased with how he took the time to get my husband and I what we wanted. The manager even showed us a floor model, even offering if we didn't get the quote on that day he would call us assuring us no one would buy it. That they themselves would call and we could put credit down over the phone to keep it. We even offered to leave some type of deposit before leaving that day. Told us it would just complicate things. That the bed hasn't sold all week and he would be there the rest of the evening. Excited to get the furniture with quote in hand the next day I walked in with my quote. I was rather uncomfortable to work with the sales associate who they put on the quote. We tried multiple times to work with a different sales associates since your store is a non commissioned store. They began to look up the quote. The floor model was sold. I then asked to see another manager the one who quoted me originally was not there. They told me they did know I may be coming and the bed was sold and it was first come first serve basis. Telling him what the other manager told me he said he didn't know about that and at that moment I felt as if I was being called a lier in my opinion. He was nice enough to offer me a different bed. For that I was greatful! Although I had to settle because it was only one option that I was able to choose from.Decided to continue to move forward with the purchase. Asking to finance the sales associate puts the paperwork on the table. The sales associate looks at me and tells me if I do not have a credit score of 600 or better to not bother to fill it out. Although the day prior the manager said there was multiple ways to finance. I was really taken aback by that comment.Now we are at the final stage of going over the order. I noticed that the bed I was purchasing didn't come with slats. So I told the sales associate the manager I set the quote with assured me the  bed would come with some type of slats. They told me no it doesn't. So I asked can you even use it without a box spring and or slats. They sales associate then asks me if the person who is going to use the twin bed is thin or heavy? I'm not sure the type of training the employees receive at Home Zone to not know their products, to ask a question of how heavy or thin a person should be to lay on the bed for it to be functional. The sales associate asks the manager if the bed would work without a box spring. They told me it wouldn't but I could gladly buy one. My experience for shopping at your store for the first time was tainted. My parents who were also looking to buy furniture I advised them not to. They were also there with us the day of the original quote so they remember what the manager told is as well.

We dealt with a young salesman named Jason. We saw a red ottoman that we were interested in, so we asked a few specifics about it. It appeared to be a leather ottoman, but I wanted to make sure it was genuine leather. Jason assured us that it was genuine leather, and given the price, I believed him. We ended up purchasing the ottoman and subsequently picked it up a few days later. After having it at home for about a week or so, I started to notice that I could see weaving underneath the surface of the \u201cleather\u201d. I started doing some research, and ran across the same ottoman online, and it was listed as fabric, not leather. At that point, I pulled out my invoice and saw that all sales were final.  Eventually, I got around to contacting the store directly to explain what had occurred, as we felt mislead, and certainly wouldn\u2019t have purchased the ottoman if we\u2019d known it was fake leather. I spoke with a manager and explained that we were told the item was genuine leather and that I\u2019d come to find out it was not. He asked who helped us. I told him, and he called Jason over. I could hear him asking Jason in the background if he\u2019d told us it was leather, and he acknowledged that he had. The manager returned to the phone and told me that he was sorry that we were misinformed, and that this would be a learning experience for Jason. I didn\u2019t think that was adequate, as we wouldn\u2019t have purchased it had we known the truth in the beginning. I explained that to him, and he told me that he\u2019d talk to some people and see what he could do. I gave him my number and he eventually called me back. He said that he was unable to accept a return of the item because I had it in my possession for two weeks. The ottoman still has the tags on it and is in the same condition it was in when it was purchased. So, we were told the item was genuine leather, they acknowledged that we were misinformed and apologized, but they still wouldn\u2019t take the item back, and that\u2019s extremely poor customer service. It\u2019s not our fault that we were misinformed. We trusted that we were buying what we were told we were buying. In this case, I believe they should\u2019ve taken it back because it was their mistake, not ours. We asked questions and sought clarification before purchasing.

Hearing it would be a good place to purchase living room furniture because prices and furniture were good.

It took about 2 weeks to deliver. Thought the delivery charge was high, but had no choice since we  are elderly and have no way of transporting furniture ourselves. The sales person (Heath) said because it was coming from the warehouse in Grandbury the delivery charge was higher.  The store is only approximately 8 miles or so from our house and it was $100 to deliver one love seat. When we got it I was very upset because I was sure it was a different from item we bought because what we received was VERY UNCOMFORTABLE and this added to my back problems. Went back to the store and spoke with another salesperson about our situation and he said we would have to use it a couple weeks to see if it gets any better, then come back to the store and talk to them.  Asked him how long the love seat we sat in had been on the floor and he said 1 year.  I feel that It is a bit deceptive to have furniture that long on the floor that had been well broken in from being used, to make the customer think this is what they will get.  I expected my love seat to feel like the one in the store, which was extremely comfortable. It should have been noted to us by the salesman that what we purchase may not be as comfortable as the one on the floor. Not  happy with our experience.  You get what you get and don't expect anything you buy to feel or fit like the furniture you sample on the floor. Also,no Veterans or elderly discounts.  Right now I am making do with what we have trying to adjust with pillows and such to make it feel better. Totally not happy with our experience.

Went to go find someone else & the manager motioned to some other lady that could help me (I guess she can't ring anybody up).  The 3rd lady was clueless and struggled to get me wrung up properly.  She told me that since it was their \"Labor Day Sale\" that the way she had to ring it up voided the warranty so it couldn't be returned. It was so shady that I asked her if it was a used mattress or if it was really a NEW mattress. What \"sale\" voids a warranty?@?@?@ It wasn't on clearance or in their \"damaged/broken/final sale only\" section.  What if it was delivered damaged?  Since I saw a commercial on TV every 10min that weekend, it was a huge red flag when she said it would have no warranty.  I tried to google and found some other people with that complaint, so this is something the company needs to CHANGE.Then, I wanted a bed frame --she told me at first it couldn't be delivered with the bed.  Then the manager corrected her & said that it could.  She rang it up but neglected to tell me it was a separate delivery fee and the fee was nearly was much as the bed frame!!! $40+ delivery fee for a $60 frame???? When I'm already paying another delivery fee for the mattress?  Go fly a kite.  Then she had to completely cancel the sale because she didn't ask if it was ok first.  Then it took FOREVER to get it rung back up.  The entire check out process took an hour after I spent 15 min finding the mattress. I almost walked out 5x and probably should have, but I'd already spent SO long I didn't want to start the process all over again at another store. But, I won't be back.  Goodness knows how long it would have taken if I had done their financing. I just paid cash & it took that long.  Painful.

The sales rep said she would call us around 2. Five o'clock comes around, still no call. So my fianc\u00e9 calls, and they said our furniture was there but forgot to call us. So we had to haul across town, in the middle of traffic. It was a nightmare. Once we got it home, it was difficult to set up. The furniture is nice, but I can tel the quality sucks. Don't buy from Homezone. Go somewhere else.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "HORRIBLE!!", "text": "I purchased a full bedroom suit and couch from Home Zone on 1/12/17 and the furniture was delivered on 1/17/17. In the process of bringing the items into my home the delivery company used a brick from my landscape to prop my storm door open so far it stressed the wood frame pulling out the screws and breaking the metal bracket to the closer and pulling those screws out. The delivery company also installing the furniture damaged the dresser, nightstand, foot board, head board, and side runners of the bed frame with deep notches to hair line scratches. I immediately contacted the store and was informed that I had to call the delivery center to speak with the Supervisor which I did right away. The Supervisor asked that I text him the photos which was also done right away and he stated that he would get replacements out that coming Tuesday. The Supervisor informed me that he would send the photos over to the delivery company as they are a 3rd party contractor and they would be in touch with me. At 2:01pm that afternoon I received a call from the 3rd party company informing me that someone will be calling me within 48 hours to schedule a time to repair my door. (2/27/17 no word from the person who will repair my door or the 3rd party delivery company) Later that afternoon on my way home from work I stopped by the store and spoke with the store Manager. I informed him of what had taken place during the delivery/installation and he apologized. I asked for the delivery fee to be refunded due to the issues and the store Manager informed me that I needed to wait 24 hours as the delivery company needed to close the ticket out before it would show in his system to be able to complete the refund. I completely understood that. The store Manager asked me to email him the photos of the damage which I did while sitting there and we confirmed they were received. While speaking with the store Manager the delivery Supervisor called him to inform him of my situation although hours had passed. During that call I explained that my husband or I could not miss work so we changed the delivery of the replacement furniture to be delivered on 2/25/17. The store Manager said that he was sending the photos over to his Owner who would not be happy about the situation and he showed me the blurry dark photos that the delivery/installers took after everything was set up in my home and told me they were unacceptable photos that they submitted. On 2/21/17 I stopped by the store and received my refund back for the delivery fee and was informed by the Assistant Manager that he had very little information as to what was going on. At 1:12pm on 2/24/17 I contacted the store again regarding my door and the store Manager informed me that I needed to contact the delivery Supervisor regarding the damages. I explained that I'm not calling all of the other departments as this is their responsibility to resolve and not mine. I was told that I would receive a call that afternoon back from the store Manager and never got a call. I tried to call an 800 number that pulled up online for the Corporate Office for Home Zone as the store claimed they didn't have a corporate number to provide however the number online did not work. I also called the Lewisville store to see if they could provide me with a number and they told me the best thing would be to call their customer care number however I haven't been able to get anyone to answer there either. At 5:21pm on 2/24/17 I called the delivery department Supervisor to verify we were still on the schedule for the Saturday (2/25/17) delivery of the replacement number but only got his voicemail so I left a message. I never received a return call confirming the delivery. On2/25/17 at 11:36am I called the store and asked for the store Manager who was with a customer so I could confirm the delivery and the gentleman on the phone asked me to leave a message. I told him I would call back as no one every returns my calls. I then called the delivery Supervisor who again did not answer the phone. I called the store back at 11:50am and left a message for the store Manager to call me back. Around 1:15pm after not receiving any return calls I went to the store where I was greeted by both the store Manager and Assistant Manager. Neither could provide answers and the store Manager stated that he was waiting on his Regional Manager to call him back. In the middle of me continuing to complain for the lack of answers, care, or concern in regards to this matter the Regional called. The store Manager stepped in a back room then came out and stated he was sending the photos to his Regional which I thought was done back on the 17th per our conversation. The store Manager looked up the delivery schedule and informed me that the replacement furniture was not on the schedule for this day (25th) as previously discussed therefore my son was still stuck with his room in a disarray. I explained how ridiculous this had become and my son could not put up all of this clothing as we thought the replacement furniture was coming and we had already moved his mattresses again for the second time. I asked why they couldn't deliver the replacement furniture and he stated because the schedule was already full. I explained that the delivery department informed him that he would push someone on the schedule to make sure it was delivered. The store Manager acted as if we never spoke of the delivery of the replacement furniture and stated that he thought the delivery Supervisor was setting that up with me. I asked if the Regional could provide a depreciated value on the furniture that was damaged as that is something we would also think about as a resolution and the store Manager said he would mention that. Everyone also still seemed surprised that I hadn't heard anything about repairing my storm door. I told the store Manager that if the 3rd party delivery company's repair man did not call me that day then I would like a copy of their insurance to file a claim to get my door fixed. I explained that the repair would be under $100 more than likely but if I needed to file an insurance claim on their policy then I would. I was informed that the store did not have a copy of the insurance so I asked the store Manager to ask for a copy of it from the Regional. After everyone was done pointing fingers at each other the store Manager stated that either the Assistant Manager or himself would call me by 6pm on Monday the 27th. At 6:49pm on Monday I called the store because once again no one follows through with what they say they will do. The store Manager was out and the Assistant Manager was busy. I received a call about 10 mins later from the Assistant Manager apologizing for the delay however he didn't have any answers for me either. I told him that I would be filing numerous complaints with different agencies to see if someone could help since they won't or can't. I explained that I still hadn't heard from the repair man and the Assistant Manager asked for the number he provided me to the repair man for my door on Saturday. I retrieved the number from my car and provided it to the Asst. Mgr. He said he was going to try to call him himself. While typing this complaint, at 7:44pm, I received a call from the repair Supervisor who stated his guy tried to call me on the 20th but was told they had the wrong number and he was going to send me an email but he just hadn't done it yet. He stated that his guy would be out tomorrow 2/28 to look at my door between 5 and 6pm to see what needs to be done to repair it. also while typing this, I just received a call back from the Assistant Mgr calling to confirm that the repair Supervisor did call me this evening and he just wanted to follow up. I thanked him for doing that and for following up.  I find it amazing that after filing all of these complaints now I'm being blamed for causing the damage.

What I initially went in for, was on the show room floor but was told serveral times the items were unavailable, until basically I settled for something I really didn't want. Well when it came time to make the purchase,I was told I needed a credit or debit card, in which I have, but not in my possession at the time, so I had to drive home get it then return. When I returned, the representative was having lunch, told me basically to walk around and see if I wanted anything else while they finished their lunch. So I continued to shop, there were other items I could have used, and I do understand employees are entitled to a lunch break. Well after finishing lunch, I was told they would be right back. Well about 15 minutes went by, I started looking for them, they then appeared as if they was coming from outside. When they approached me, they smelled like cigarette smoke. So not only did they finish lunch while I waited, but smoked as well. So after much of my time was wasted, we begin going over the stipulations of the buying process, only to be told then that I needed my bank account and routing number. By then, I had completely had enough.  I couldn't help but wonder as to why earlier when I was told I needed a debit/credit card, and they knew I had to go get it, why would they not tell me other information that I would need so that when I returned I would have the proper information I needed to complete the purchase? Just did not seem like good customer service to me. Did not have any items I wanted, but I was still willing to purchase something from the establishment anyway? Then to be sent on a wild goose chase to retrieve the proper information I needed, when I could have been told from the beginning,  just seemed like the representative did not want to make a sale. I noticed all the customers that were in the store at the time I was walked out, just like me, without making a purchase. Not good for business if you ask me. But I would like to thank the sales representive, since I had to go through so much only not to make a purchase, I shopped at other establishments and found everything I wanted, at a much lower price, and could purchase in any form of payment without having to be told no 3 times. So thank you, I'm happy with all my purchases I did not make at homezone and did not go broke trying to upgrade my house.

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I obviously told her that was not the case and she scheduled me for a new appointment. The appointment day came, the repair people showed up and repaired the chair, they took a look at the bed, and they said the people who did the assembling did a very poor job. (Surprise, surprise). Sadly it doesn't end there. A few more months passed by, and just as predicted by our sales rep, the paint of our dresser peeled, my husband left a glass of ice water overnight. I dreaded having to contact them again but, I figured that was the point of purchasing EXTENDED WARRANTY RIGHT? Well this time the team has said it doesn't appear to be a manufacturer defect.. Seriously?? I asked them for the contact information for a supervisor and have yet to receive a response. Please do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY, DO NOT BUY extended warranty it\u2019s a waste of your money!", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Worst Experience ever", "text": "The entire experience was a nightmare.  I bought a bedroom suite from the store in Waco, Mitch was the salesman.  He was border line rude and obnoxious.  He kept trying to get me to finance the items when I wanted to pay the total payment.  He first told me the delivery date would be June 29 but by the time he quit trying to convince me to finance and ran the payment all the delivery times had been taken.  He then rescheduled for July 5th, telling me someone would call me the day before.  I asked if that meant someone would call me on the Fourth of July, he paused and then said yes.  No one called me on the 4th, I was called around 5:15 AM Tuesday morning, telling me they would be there between 4:30 and 8:30 that evening.  The truck arrived close to 9 PM.  While trying to set up the be it was noticed by the delivery men that one bed rail was damaged and one drawer on the dresser would not close.  They took pictures and told me they were sending the pictures to the store where I bought the furniture.  They told me to call and the store would schedule a date to have the items repaired.  When I called no one knew anything about the pictures or the damage.  After several phone calls between me and the store manager he said I could be contacted to set up a time for the repairs.  No one ever called me, but did call my wife and set up a time on Friday at 4:30.  I was working nights and did not see her, and she forgot to tell me.  Friday afternoon the crew showed up, but I had went to play golf and my wife had plans and could not stay there.  I had to leave the course and rush home to be there to make sure everything was taken care of.  I will never buy anything from Home Zone again, and have already started telling everyone I know to stay away from this business.  I was treated with no respect or consideration.  Everything had to be done on their schedule, with no regard to anything going on in our lives.It is not possible to explain everything that was wrong with this ordeal in a review and would like to talk to someone outside of the Waco store, but the website has no corporate office phone number, which I think I know why now.

Instead I received an automated voice message at 6:15pm telling me the time they were coming and if I need to make changes to call back. I called back and of course no one answered the phone and the recording said \"if you have reached us after 6pm, please call back the next business day\". I called back the next business day and no one answered the phone. I literally called every hour on the hour.

My partner and I  came into the Mesquite store and spent the better part of   3 hrs purchasing so living room furniture with an associate named Holly.  We  completed the process and got a delvery scheduled for 3/12.  The  sales order is 01167120.  The driver called me en route and arrived as scheduled. They delivered the chair, recliner, end tables but the Katrina sofa was a challenging and I do not feel the guys did what could be done to get the sofa in my condo.  Therefore the sofa was not delivered. I called Chris the general manager and told him of my concern that the crew did not make a concerned effort to get my sofa in my house and he rescheduled a DIFFERENT crew to re-deliver the sofa on Tuesday, 3/15.  I asked that I be called ahead of time so that I can be home since it is a weekday and I have to work.  He stated he was concerned about this going right because he would be off that day and he gave me the name of the assistant manager, Larry.  Monday came and left with no phone call with a delivery time frame. I called the delivery manager number MULTIPLE times and no answer.  On  Tuesday afternoon approx 1pm I call the store and speak with Larry and he called the delivery manager who ironically delivery time was 2pm - 6pm.  At this point I asked to be put towards the latter time because I AM AT WORK AND AT LEAST 20-30 min away.  Larry called me back and told me the delivery manager was informed and they would CALL   ME when they were en route.  The called MY PARTNERS number who lives in New Jersey instead of the local number on the sales order  682-561-2504 and she is a driver and almost LOST her job answering the calls.  The crew called ONCE THEY WERE N FRONT OF THE HOUSE!! Once I was notified they were in front og the house, I called the delivery manager and advised I would be home in 20 min minimum and why did the crew NOT CALL prior to arriving?  He gave me MAJOR ATTITUDE and said he the crew is contracted and they are not obligated to wait past 15 mins!! I said they did not call the correct number!  Needless to say, I arrived and the crew was not here and the delivery manager was not helpful when I asked for my sofa to be brought back. He referred me back to the store and said all he could do is rescheduled for tomorrow!!  I said so I can take MORE TIME OFF WORK????  I called the store back and spoke with Larry yet again and advised that I am DONE with HomeZone and I want EVERYTHING purchased picked up IMMEDIATELY!!

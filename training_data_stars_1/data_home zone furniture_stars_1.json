So I am stuck with this. Just will not recommend purchasing from Home Zone or purchase again as furniture is not the best qualityI purchased 3 pieces of furniture 8/2024 and requested electric for a three was assured by salesman that all 3 pieces would be electric. Day of delivery 2 recliners were electric but loveseat was manual. So they had to get electric loveseat delivered but charged e additional amount for electric when it was salesman error. The 2nd loveseat arrives and the foot rest doesn\u2019t go down all the way, center piece stuck out further that right left sides. And the middle section had a split piece in the support. They were going to pick it up and do repairs and leave me with nothing to sit in when there\u2019s 3 people is the house. I refused and said I had warranty and I wanted a new loveseat. 3rd one comes and mechanism on one recliner section is broken. Repair guy came out to replace mechanism and new footrest doesn\u2019t line up with the center section and right side recliner is not even with middle section. Customer service said it\u2019s normal for footrest to not line up when new mechanism put in and that it will eventually go even and the back is normal. Normal for one side to not be even with middle and right side. Manage said I can return the furniture and at 20% fee for them having to take it back. Don\u2019t bother buying from this company. I purchased in the Denton Tx store. They would charge me fee to take furniture back and I get no refund. Great company, yeah right.. don\u2019t bother buying from them or be careful if you do. Take pictures of the piece in store and compare it to what you actually get",

Some of the same items where Pick-up at store, Delivery and then Pick-up at warehouse.  Customers did not understand why they had to have an item only delivered.  Then to schedule the delivery date and/or do financing.  We could not pick up the items that date at the warehouse.  We had to wait for a text.  At 2:45pm, the next day (Sat), I got a text, my couch is ready for pickup.  I drive to the warehouse and now there are over 30 cars waiting for a pick up.  Never again will I purchase something from Home Zone.",

She was very rude at times one time in particular was when she asked me to \u201cshhh\u201d. Completely unacceptable My partner and I close on our house very soon and came in to get s mattress we had seen our last visit a few months back. And also got a lot of other projects. Even with only settling for just a few things less than we would have liked our total was around $6,000. And the last employee we spoke to months back told us about a $100 off if we spend over $2000 and we asked her about it and she lied saying it didn\u2019t exist. My partner asked for a manager and the manager applied it with no problem. And she still seemed uncomfortable with that, which I don\u2019t understand why. We still need to find a few more things to finish our shopping but she definitely did not make our shopping pleasant. So idk if we would go back to that location.",

        "text": "Went in to the Lawton, OK store and found what we wanted.  We were given the financing options and told that if we didn't want to pay interest they had a 90 day no interest option.  I have dealt with Mathis Bros, Rooms to Go and several others that had this option so we opted for it.  We were told that the payments would be every 2 weeks UNLESS we called when we took delivery and changed it to the 90 days.  Any other time we have used this option, no payments had to be made until the 90 days and then if you couldn't pay in full the payments would begin and you paid a lot of interest.  So when he used the phrase UNLESS YOU CHANGE IT, that's how it was represented to mean, no payments for 90 days.  I called to change it and was told just the opposite.  The bi-weekly payments would double to pay it off in 90 days.  I was then told \"we can come pick it up\".  I didn't want to dip that deep into my savings but was pretty much forced to.  Also, they don't tell you it's a rental agreement.  So when you use their 3rd party financing, it's just like going to Rent-a-Center and it ends up costing you double if you don't pay in full.  If I hadn't been sick of searching for what I needed, I would have let them come get it.  They grossly misrepresented their financing options.  They should let the customer know they are walking into a lease agreement, not an outright purchase. We didn't know it was a no credit check option because we had to enter our info and wait to see if we were approved.  They need their people to explain better and not use phrases that make it sound like no payments for 90 days and then you have no interest. ",

This was never told to me initially or discussed when I paid them to deliver to my apartment. They also failed to deliver the chair at all, despite it very easily and unquestionably fitting in the elevator. They can\u2019t offer an estimated time of delivery until 24 hours out, and they will charge you to reschedule if you do so within 48 hours, which unfortunately doesn\u2019t make much sense as they won\u2019t give me an estimate until 24 hours out. As a single full time hospital employee, that\u2019s hard to work around and getting off at the drop of a dime is difficult/near impossible.

        "text": "After having a wonderful customer service experience in the Round Rock store I was very disappointed with the quality of the furniture I received. In July/August of 2023 I initially purchased the City Limits Gray leather sectional. Long story short, it was gray in the store, but brown when I received it\u2026 lighting I was told? I visited the store a handful of times, got measurements, moved furniture around, matched with pillows, etc to be sure about my purchase since there are no refunds so imagine my disappointment when the color wasn\u2019t even close.(I have pictures)  The manager of the RR store did an excellent job of helping me exchange  (keep in mind I didn\u2019t care for any other furniture in the store but had no choice with the no refund policy). I decided on the City Limits Fabric sofa after reading the description which says in part, and I quote (copied directly from the website) \u201c Our new patent-pending technology combines down and feather seating with memory foam support for maximum comfort with rapid recovery so the cushions keep their shape. \u201d After less than a month of very little use ( only sat on by me & that wasnt often bcs I work all day) the cushions started to sag, did not recover, & did not keep their shape).. When I\u2019d had enough I hesitantly called the store (hesitant bcs I\u2019m not the complaining customer, and didn\u2019t want to seem troublesome). I was told since I\u2019d had the sofa 5 months I would have to file a claim. I filed the claim, cancelled another important appointment to be home in the window of time I was given just to have the tech come out and flip the cushion inside the sofa. I was then told that nothing can be done, I would always have to manually recover & reshape the cushions after use (unzip the cover, remove the filling & flip it) because of the down filling. I have never owned a sofa that requires you to reshape the cushions by hand everytime you sit on it. The description is very misleading and the warranty was a complete waste of time. Very sad because the employees in the Round Rock store are amazing. Great people selling way less than great furniture.",

You have declined to honor coverage for the mattress I purchased which clearly has a manufacturing defect because I MOVED??? With professional movers.  Their handling of the mattress did NOT cause it to come apart at the seams. A lack of adequate selvage during manufacturing caused that. You can be sure that I have spent my last dollar with your company and all future recommendations will be negative. Thank you for wasting my money.",

They forgot to cover a few of the foot recliners with material (bare wood was exposed), one of the recliner mechanisms was faulty, two of the side arms were crooked and a seam of a head cushion was undone (all this concluding to poor workmanship). It took until mid Dec 2021 to resolve all these issues. The customer service was on it as far as getting replacement pieces and getting the repairs done (on this new set!) However it was very inconvenient waiting for repair people and exchange pieces over the month and a half period (5 time, off work etc.)  I also pick up a few doorway nicks along the way.Originally we like the looks of the set the reclining capability and comfort, however, fast forwarding 10 month to Oct 2022 many of the cushions are loosing there support. The material of the back cushions have significant noticeable gapping (3of6 backs). Still being within our year warranty period, we contacted customer service regarding a few cushion replacements (sent pics) however they denied our claim stating it was normal wear and tear (We\u2019re talking 10-11months of wear for two people 3 pieces of furniture). We went back and forth with the dispute only to be denied.Over all, we would review this furniture as poor quality with limited durability. We wouldn\u2019t recommend other than a temporary type of furniture. Home zones stated warranty was worthless. (Unable to attach photos)",

Even for Damaged Furniture, I was told that I would have to pay a 20% restocking fee and a $99 pickup charge.  This seems so wrong!!  Where has customer service gone??  I was at one point told that it was my fault that it kept breaking because I let it slide.  They talk out of both sides of their mouths...They say they don't have issues with this bed but they knew exactly what I needed to buy at Home Depot to stop it from happening.

I could not inspect every inch of the two chairs in there dark warehouse and really didn\u2019t think I needed to however I was wrong. Lessons learned. Looking back I should have brought a flashlight and a magnifying glass with me to thoroughly inspect them. I had these chairs in my possession for less than one hour before the wife and I got them home and realized in the light that one of them had what looked to be a cut in the leather. I notified them immediately. The only response that I received was \u201csorry\u201d. They basically informed me that they would do nothing about it and it was my problem. Wow! One thing for sure is that I will never set foot in their store again. Do yourself a favor and avoid a situation like this and shop elsewhere however if you do purchase from them check each inch of every item carefully before leaving the store.

Also, the crew left our bedroom in a mess, with pieces of foam sheets and and wire ties all over the floor.  The furniture was left with the foam sheets on the drawer pulls.  In my opinion, the delivery was not done in a professional and complete manner. The delivery crew had a \"not my job\" attitude. I called to ask that the crew at lest come back and clean up their mess, and was told that it was not possible for the crew to return.  The delivery fee that I paid basically was $99 to put the furniture in the house and, according to HZ did not pay for professional assembly and set up.  HZ delivery was the wort furniture delivery experience that I have every had, and therefore, we would not buy from this store again and would not recommend HZ to anyone.

We picked out a dinning room set and a bedroom set. We choose to go with a mi piece bedroom that included the bed dresser mirror night stand and a chest. We then added an additional night stand. We choose the night stands with mirrors. The salesman went over our order with the manager to make sure it was correct. It was closing the me we were going to come back to pic out a sectional sofa. Everything was good up to this point. The next day we received a call from a manager at the store. She ask which night stands we ordered. My wife explained the ones with the mirrors. Our salesman ordered the wrong ones. She was able to correct. Then the exciting day came our new furniture was here. The delivery guy comes in and told my wife that the dinning table was broke and he didn\u2019t have it. He showed a pic of a broken leg. That was weird because the top wasn\u2019t here and the base/legs were in a box he left here. Then we go to our bedroom to see our new furniture. The chest that was part of the 7 piece set was not delivered. We were told that it wasn\u2019t in the order. We called the store to ask and was told it was never on the order. The salesman ordered the set that had 2 night stands and no chest. So again issues with my order. So now All our excitement for new furniture is ruin. My wife went to the store to speak with a manager about this. We spent $10000 in your store and my wife just wanted everything corrected and make sure the pricing was correct. She questions about the price. The manager told here he wasn\u2019t going to give the chest to her for free. She never asked for anything for free. We just want to pay for what we ordered and get the correct items. To top all this off 1of the nightstand light doesn\u2019t work and several drawers on the dresser don\u2019t close correctly. We have a service person coming out to try a fix these. We had a schedule conflict and had to move the date. Then we were told they couldn\u2019t reschedule till May 7. My wife asked to speak with a supervisor and the lady they could come this Friday but couldn\u2019t give a time and we never received a confirmation.

I eventually got my chest after another long process because it was sent back to the warehouse after I had asked a note be put on the chest since it is not easy to make the drive due to work. The staff was nice but not as helpful and neither was corporate, so one star was given even though it should be less.

I had ordered a lot of furniture and on the day of delivery the wrong couches were delivered. I immediately had the delivery man return the couches to the truck and I called the store. The sales rep first told me that I was colorblind and that I had ordered gray couches not cream because I could not distinguish color in the store. I firmly told him that I took photos of the couches that I ordered in the store and that my mother was also with me and that we had ordered cream couches. Then after doing my own research, I realized they had not only set the wrong color but the wrong model of couches as well. Once again I called the store and I reported that they had sent the wrong model of couches. Again the sales rep told me that I had put in the wrong order. I told him that that is impossible because I came into the store and he had put the order into the computer and I simply paid with my credit card. This was not an online order where I was putting in my own purchase. After back and forth calls in which I continuously had to initiate the call, it was actually a customer care associate that put in the correct order. The store also set up a second delivery date without asking me during a time that I was away on holidays. I had to once again call the customer care associate and have her override the store dates. I was left for a long time with no furniture, no apology, and no reimbursement of any kind or compensation. I even emailed the manager and called and asked for him many times and he never spoke to me or called me back. I am very upset with this service and I will be reporting this review to the better business bureau.",

They told me they would make an exception (despite the fact that we had purchased the extra warranty that apparently has little value) but we would need to pay a 20% restocking fee and $100 delivery fee to have the couches taken back. I asked repeatedly for a total on how much that would be but wasn't given one. Long story short, we were given the run around only to be met with a manager who tried to intimidate us by being rude and curt and then informing us that we would need to pay $620 (on couches and a chair that cost us $1200) and pay an additional $230 if we wanted to add a warranty to them. Needless to say, we decided to stick with the stained couches and will likely never shop at Home Zone again.

They brought the foot board for my bedroom set that was not in excellent condition as you would expect with a BRAND new product. They didn\u2019t want to take it back I had to keep fighting for the delivery guys to return it. I called store manager who told me to refuse it. The service department was literally no help at all. They wanted to come \u201cfix\u201d it. I just purchased something new that shouldn\u2019t have to be fixed! Anyway they delivered the new footboard and the drawer that\u2019s part of the bed doesn\u2019t close right. I would understand if this was the only problem however, I purchased an $1100 dining room table the chairs didn\u2019t even last 2 weeks. I called and called the service department they said sent someone to \u201cfix\u201d them which made it even worse. I purchased a living room set from there too which ended up being horrible quality there was green stuff coming out of the cushions and pillows. I gave you guys 3 chances hoping it would get better. I see nothing has changed just same old cheap quality and not even attempting to make customers happy with their purchases.",

        "text": "UPDATE: A service manager reached out to me to see if they could fix the problem with the furniture being damaged. She was super nice and helpful. However, there is not much she can do. She offered to replace the warped shelving. She stated there was zero footboard drawers in stock. (I find that interesting since I was told there was 2 before). She stated she found a brand-new pair of side drawer rails for me, still in box. She scheduled the tech to come see me (3 weeks out). Which means, I have to take more time off of work. HomeZone just keeps costing me money every time we interact. I find this quite interesting. I was told there were no more side rails hence why I had to receive used/display ones from the local store. How, after she digs into things, she was able to find me new parts (just the rails but still) but no one else could and in fact, I almost did not get any sets until I threw a fit. This is all very sketch and unprofessional. Regardless, I will have to deal with warped drawers that I paid at full price for new set. I also paid for new side rails but got display rails because it was that or nothing. Just not getting better with HomeZone. Original issue: The local store manager is aware of the issue, but I wanted to make sure to note my complete dissatisfaction with HomeZone. I have personally worked sales for many years. I am a district manager for a retailer, so I completely understand both sides of the spectrum. I have wanted a particular bed frame for quite some time. Unfortunately, before I could purchase it last year, it was went discontinued. I decided to stop in last Saturday to see if it was brought back or any info. I was greeted immediately with a new, young associate who was able to help me. He pulled up the item I wanted and stated there was two in stock. I clarified with him 3 separate times that it was back in stock. He stated it was and I could have it delivered in 4 days. Great. We ordered and set the delivery date as Wednesday. I had to get rid of my current bed immediately because HomeZone will not touch your old furniture. Tuesday, I sold my bed. At 1:19pm, I received a confirmation text stating 3 out of my 5 items are delivery the next day. The headboard, foot board and foot board drawers but no rails to connect them. I called the number and the lady said she would have to investigate but she believes the items to be out of stock. She called me back to let me know the rails were discontinued and to contact the store. I was hot. I now have no bed to sleep on considering I just sold it. I contacted the store manager. He informed me that the guy who helped me was still very new and didn't know what he was doing. (Unacceptable. Do not blame an associate for being \"new\". It is the job of the manager. He is only as strong as his weakest associate.) He apologized and stated he \"happened\" to have the rails in the warehouse. The problem was getting them delivered. He was going to load the parts on the truck but the lady on the phone deleted my appointment time for the next day (Why would you cancel someone's appointment before knowing the resolution?!). He called me back to let me know that he could get me in on Friday. So, now I will have sleep on the couch an extra 2 more nights (minimum) and possibly not get my bed. Not to mention, I took 2 days off of work for this now, the original date and the new date (who is paying me for this?). The bed arrives Friday. They put it together. The drawers are lop sided but what am I to do? I can't get them replaced. I can get a new set but I don't want any others. So, now I get to suffer with bed defects because this is the bed I want. I lost 2 days of pay for this. And I have a terrible experience. I will not be returning to HomeZone or ever purchasing from there again.It was a horrible experience and I have a damaged bed to show for it.",

        "text": "Since there is no H.R. department looking out for the best interest of the sales associates, hopefully  this review will help address that issue and the lack of leadership at the store manager level and even the regional level. The toxic environment at Homezone Furniture in Mesquite is clearly the result of Chris Cooper\u2019s micromanaging, biased and even sexist behavior to name a few. Chris Cooper has even gone as far as to speak behind his sales representatives backs and speaks poorly of them with fellow manager Robert of Burleson referring to them as \u201cdouchebags\u201d for being only seconds late lacking moral courage to confront anyone face to face, Actions and words unbecoming of managers that should set the example and not gossip and spread rumors like Chris Cooper and Robert are known to do. As long as you don\u2019t inconvenience Chris Cooper during working hours and say yes sir no sir while he is swiping left and right on Tinder and Bumble dating apps you\u2019re on his good side. I don\u2019t know about you but I thought this was a furniture store selling furniture for the hard working American not Chris Cooper\u2019s personal time but if you can provide a suitable girlfriend for Chris Cooper in exchange for furniture that he is willing to buy for you then you are also on his good side just ask the sales associates still working there. I don\u2019t think anyone of them would be willing to allow someone they know to date such a low value individual and simp. Growing up no one ever taught Chris Cooper how to become a man that explains it in his lack of masculinity towards other male associates, his sexist behavior towards other males and only hiring women because of his shortcomings as a man in his personal life, bringing stress and frustration into the workplace affecting the rest of the sales staff with his emotional behavior. Last but not least is the despicable behavior towards Oneil Whyte one of the hardest working people I have ever met, Chris Cooper singles out this young man on a daily basis. Who knows why, maybe because of the color of his skin or because he feels threatened and jealous which are common Chris Cooper traits, you should judge a man not by his skin color but the content of his character these are tough times we are in for Chris Cooper to be showing such childish behavior. Picking and choosing when things are inappropriate or \u201cred poster\u201d making up the rules of the store as he goes. You are never allowed to call in sick according to him because you hurt the team are his words but only chooses who to enforce the standards upon showing once again biased behavior and unfair treatment. I myself only ever called in sick once this year but wasn\u2019t allowed to be ill,knowing full well COVID 19 could of been present in the store which consequently shut down for a day for COVID 19 because another associate was ill. I guess selling furniture was more important than the well being and health of the staff which are grounds for a lawsuit. Fair warning to anyone choosing to work at the Mesquite location as drama follows Chris Cooper but do not stand your ground for he will certainly shed tears for not being included since it\u2019s a place of business and not a place to make friends. Let\u2019s hope these issues are dealt with swiftly so no other future associate has to deal with this.",

Finally I received an email saying they would switch out the bed and delivery set for 5/30 6pm-9:30p.  I was called once to tell me delivery delayed to 10pm.  However, they delivered at 11:15p.

They rudely asked if I had received a phone call yet. Then they said the truck JUST come in. I asked when they closed and they said 7pm. I had taken off of work to come get the furniture that day, so I asked if I could come by and get it. They said no, and that they would call tomorrow, the 21st. Around 1pm the next day, I called and again was asked if they had called me to notify me the furniture came in yet. I said no, and then was told it was there for me to pick up. Guys, I\u2019m this day and age, customer service is crucial to any business.

We purchased before the store closed for Corona and got our delivery but the guys who brought our furniture said they were being told if they didnt show up for any reason, they would be fired. You should not be threatening these men knowing we were on the eve of a global pandemic telling them they will be fired if they stay home for their health. Thats very sad because you also put your customers health in danger too. The furniture is okay so that's why I say 2 stars.Editing my comment to give one star. Do not call me a liar. I had your guys in my home and none of the employees who are responding to this email were there. Also there were no masks or gloves on them.

I will waited that Friday and no show so I called and was told it didn\u2019t show that I called you o move the date up. So my Friday was a disaster. I was told the deliver was scheduled still for Saturday. Again, I wasted a Saturday evening waiting on them to deliver. I received email confirming delivery and all. The window I was given was between 4pm-8pm. I tried to track my order and it stated that my order number was not valid. I called the number to track the order and the representative told me that it was cancelled. I asked how is that possible? She didn\u2019t know and transferred me to the Mesquite store. I explained to the lady that was the assistant manager that I was speaking with that I didn\u2019t go into any store to cancel my order what was the problem and how did this happen? No one could tell me anything. So low and behold I had to wait until Monday. I drive 35-40 minutes ones at to work. I was sitting at my desk for about an hour and received a call that they would be at my house with my delivery in about an hour. I had to take off from work and shoot home and wait about 20 minutes and the drivers did show as stated. Once they deliver d it I had to drive back to work and lost 2 hours of work. I feel like that was basically double the charge of the cost of the delivery because I was out of office for 2 hours. So disappointed and I will think twice before I go back to Homezone to purchase anything else. Frustrated, upset and angry.

No I\u2019m upset because of the poor service. You are using date of purchase instead of replacement date. From the pictures you have ruined my couch. My cushion had no wrinkles and now it does.  They will not answer my emails I am asking if the holes in the fabric were repaired.  These holes were worn because obviously the foot rest was out of alignment so when you raised it up and down it rubbed the fabric. No one with any backbone will speak with me. They know I\u2019m right. When something had to be repaired and repaired and replaced for the same reason I should be offered my full amount back. Which is 1445.16. Not the measly amount they are offering me. I can\u2019t even buy a chair for that amount.  I knew they were gonna pull what they are doing now. Making we wait all day for them to bring back my furniture how freakin sorry is that. I\u2019ve had to postpone once due to them wanting to deliver while I was at work   Sorriest company ever",

So after arguing for them to keep the appointments they set for 30 minutes they decided finally they could come back tomorrow to fix it. An finally I\u2019d had enough of their crap and told them if they are going to be shady about doing what they say and not trying to fix my 2000$ couch they could come and pick it up and I\u2019d take my business elsewhere.

We also considered an adjustable base but were concerned that it would not work with the bedframe we were looking at as it had under drawers and also the thickness of the mattress would make it to tall even without the adjustable base.  We voiced our concerns and the sales lady asked another associate and they reassured us that it would work.  We left and came back the next day asking again to be reassured but thinking all along if it doesnt work we can just return it and find something that would work though it would be a hassle but again the assosiates reassured us that it would work.  On the second day in the store we purchased the bed, over a $3,000 purchase.  All but 1200 in cash.  We pick it up the following Saturday, assemble the bed which sat up tall enough that we had to have a step stool to get on the bed.  My husband has heart trouble, he could not get on the bed so he had to sleep on the couch.  First thing the next day called spoke with a manager and was told at that point sorry, we have a no return policy.  I get out my paperwork and sure enough in tiny print at the bottom of this paperwork it said no returns. This paperwork which was not given to me until the purchase was done and I was heading out the door. NEVER during this purchase was I told NO RETURNS. The manager did say he would send an email to the corporate office to see if they would make an exception. Told him just the bedframe and would be ok with buying another from them that would work.    Gave it a couple days before I called back.  I have yet to hear from him or anybody and I have called several times and have even gone in to the store but Im told Ill need to talk to him and hes never available.  We tried even setting the adjustable base on the floor and it does not fit into the frame.  I also after looking online at the lease invoice,  they have all of the items I purchased on the lease agreement even though I paid cash for the Mattress and Adjustable base.

Again employees didn\u2019t care about that policy. (At least that is the way they made me feel.)",

First, it was delivered damaged, so, free of charge they sent out a replacement top.  When they delivered the replacement top, they didn't take the blocks off that allowed it to be extended.  SO, they sent out a technician.  The technician took off the blocks, but then when we pointed out a blemish on the tabletop he tried to fix it and made it worse.  When I called to complain I was told I would be charged a $100 service fee to have it picked up to be fixed.  Thankfully they waived that and refunded our delivery fee.  At this point, I was very upset and just want my table to be in good condition.  So they come pick it up to repair the damage that was caused by the technician, they take both the table and the base.  They fix it and when they finally bring it back, they brought it back with no base.  At this point, the manager of the warehouse comes out and brings us our base.  This was almost 6 weeks after the initial purchase.  And the manager made sure he told us he came in on his day off to bring it to us. I will say that the manager of the Arlington store was very helpful and refunded us our delivery fee plus a little more, but I would never shop at home zone again.  I would also never recommend  home zone to anyone I like.",

I will proceed to contact corporate CEO of Home Zone then I will contact the SEC and the United States Attorney Generals Office.

The delivery driver was distracted with his personal business (which he told me about the second he walked in my door) he was never punished to my knowledge. They lost our business after we pay this off.",

When the 1 guy they had there to load my stuff up came out with my loveseat he tore open the bottom corner of the leather on the concrete. When I went to talk to the manager I was only offered a 50 dollar discount for a 800 dollar piece. Then when I got home with the loveseat the electrical leg lift didnt work and when I flipped the seat over it was cutt open on bottom and missing a wire that goes to the motor. When I called and told the manager she told me they would send a tech out to fix it or come pick up the loveseat. One week later I still havent heard from a tech or the manager  so I called back and talked to her again. She finally got the service tech to call me. Only to be told that they was booked for the week and wouldnt be able to get my furniture fixed till the following week.",

It is a one time warranty use. I rarely have company.. The sectional springs broke in the recliner and cushion sunk in and one of the other recliner the outlet stop working, the bed started peeling and the dining table screws keep loosing and the cushion are flat. I registered the products on Homezone warranty websites with pictures I had to pay additional fee for the pickup repair service or take the furniture to the store for repair. Homezone sent a technician out to touch up the bed and tighten the table legs. The tech stated the bed should have went to shop for repair.  I spoke with the service department had a back and forth disagreement with the representative regarding repair of the bed color. The issue was escalated I spoke with the supervisor and then the GM. He apologized for the representative behavior. I was told homezone is not a repair company. So the color of the bed will be a different color. I have hsd a bare living room for over a week and the bed need to be picked up. No return date for the sectional.  I am not a happy customer.  This will be my last purchase at homezone. \ud83e\udd28",

I asked Isabella if layaway was available. She said yes. She said 20% down, with monthly payments and you have 6 months to pay it off. Sounded like a good deal....WRONG! The catch is, Home Zone only guarantees the PRICE of an item while on layaway, NOT the actual item! So in other words, if I place a couch on layaway, they can sell it right out beneath me, and they can either give me my money back that I had paid on my couch through layaway OR I can choose something else in the store! This does NOT make any sense to me. She said it was their policy since so many people place things on layaway and then stop paying on it. Ok I might can understand if the people are NOT making payments towards their layaway, but if someone is ACTIVELY making payments towards their layaway, Home Zone SHOULD NOT sell that item! When you put something on layaway, that guarantees that item is spoken for by a particular customer! THAT'S WHAT LAYAWAY IS!!!! I'll be DAMN if I place something on layaway and the store turns right around and sells it! I would NOT be doing business with this company.

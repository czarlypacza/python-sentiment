I called today, she seemed quite agitated or irritated, saying that we spent over an hour on the phone going over everything approximately a week or so ago. She assumed I had picked United healthcare in fact I told her I did not make a decision and that is why I was calling back today. I needed more information about several other plans to get all of my doctors under the same Medicare advantage plan. She seemed in a hurry and told me she would call me back. I told her okay it can wait until Monday. Then I realized she did not understand at all what I was trying to do because she several times reminded me that we went over this in our first call. I specifically told her I did not make a decision that day. And I was calling today hoping to make a decision on which plan I wanted to take depending on whether my doctors were in those plans Network. She seemed in a hurry to get off the phone and so we hung up. I decided to go with a different insurance company because I felt she misunderstood our first conversation and I really didn't want to go over everything, I just wanted to find out about two other possibilities. Then I would make a decision. So I did not get a permanent answer and not satisfied. I called back and a different person answered started to explain to her why I am choosing another company. And to let the previous agent know not to call me back. Then all of a sudden I was hung up on. I thought maybe it was a mistake and she would call me back but did not. I tried again and called this time the agent that I was working with answered the phone. Apparently she was not too busy after all. I am very disappointed in feeling rushed and that they expected me to make an a decision without going through my questions. She did not remember our conversation prior to today's correctly. Very disappointed and cannot believe I was hung up on without trying to make the situation better it was made worse by being disrespectful. Letty you had time to answer the phone but you had no time to work with me. Try putting yourself in my situation and others maybe you will have patience for the elderly or disabled.

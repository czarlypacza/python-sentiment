Then having been directed to another agent, I was told that I was $10 over the $300 maximum, so could not collect, then having to call and call multiple agents and being told that either they were not open (this is during business hours, not late at night) even though their website said they were, or they could not pay out because I was $10 over the maximum. Called another Safeway to confirm the details and it was like pulling teeth, trying to get --again-- the ONE qualified employee to tell me whether she would be there.  \"I'll try to be there,\" she said and would not commit to doing her job!  Try to be there?  Is this a business or some kind of \"I'll do it when I feel like it but actually you the client are not that important\" kind of operation?  What a major pain in the behind.

Well, you will have to take a picture of your ID/passport and send it via email or upload it to a website. Another option they give you is to reply with your personal information (ID, place of bith, address, phone number, etc.) to an email they'll send you. Not safe.

After I did the transaction in person I received an email stating that my transaction was \"under review\". 24 hrs. later, it was still under review.

For how long my money will be frozen I don't know. Western Union, never again. To top it off, if you call, no one will transfer you with a supervisor, you will get a representative that has been trained to say \"I am really sorry that this happemed to you, I understand...\" and will tell you to send your ID digitally or wait 24 hrs. After 24 hrs. of silence, you will call again and then, they will tell you that they will send an email to escalate your case to the next office and that they will take 7 working days or so to review your case and come up with the resolution.

I usually never leave reviews but I\u2019m so frustrated on how bad the service is getting. The last 2 years I had so many bad experiences that I can\u2019t count them anymore. Starting from the fact that now is not possible to pay through gateway online but you have to do a bank transfer to Al Fardan exchange and insert the reference number. I can deal with that fine, but than they tell you 1 to 3 days will send your money and it takes more like 1 to 2 weeks even though you send email complaining and receipt of payment they keep telling you we are prioritizing your transfer whatever. Time pass and than this last time they even lie to me , telling me that my bank didn\u2019t release the money, when I check with my back they mention we haven released it the day after the initiation. But this is not all , you need to pray that there is no glitch in the system like happen to me or that you don\u2019t make any mistakes otherwise you\u2019ll see your money returned to you after a month or so , this is the time they take , unreasonable and ridiculous if you ask me.

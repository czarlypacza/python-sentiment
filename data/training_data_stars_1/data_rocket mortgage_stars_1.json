The Home inspection had a lot of problems and even had a large hole in the roof with rain going inside the house. We cancelled the RE Contract ASAP. We contacted the Broker and sent a copy of the cancellation to her as well. She said I will get my refund back in 10 days. After 10 days we still did not get our refund and spoke to the Supervisor and she said it was processed 3 days ago. Also she said the refund was only 300.00 and that they charged us 100.00 per person for the hard credit pull. When I heard that I hit the wall. I told the supervisor(Angela Ramos) that it is against the customer loan protection law that you can not charge a borrower without disclosing the cost so the borrower can decide if they want this done.

Each week, I was told that the loan should be wrapped up and ready for closing, but instead it was just one issue after another. All the issues I was told (excuses is what I actually started to believe) was that there were technical challenges, issues with appraisal (back and forth between drive-by and hard appraisal), the SSN transposed so the IRS couldn't provide the information needed, documents not properly being reviewed/audited before forwarding to the IRS, paperwork to the IRS not being completed, requests to physically print and sign documents (when they could all be done electronically) so taking the time to physically drive to a location to print and scan a single document, not being given the correct information up-front such as closing cost information, being told our credit was good enough to be approved for the amount requested, but then being told later we needed to pay down a credit card to a certain amount, and then in the end, still not getting the amount requested because the appraisal didn't come back at the amount they were initially thinking. Each time an issue came up, it would take 3 to 5 business days for that issue to get resolved. The list goes on.

The initial purchase of my home, the process took a bit over a month to get through and they required verification of every cent of my worth, but could not count money I had taken out of the bank to purchase a vehicle, which I ended up returning the same money into the bank. Due to this I needed to muster another $3,000 because that cash could not be 'verified.' I came up with the money, they re-ran their math prior to closing and told me I was $37.00 short. I said you have to be kidding me, and sent a photo of 2 $20.00 bills in my wallet (though they would be unverified). They actually managed to close even though they couldn't verify these $37.I was contacted every six months about refinancing, usually to go through the process and get credit checked and talk with them for a couple weeks, just to end up with \"Well there isn't anything better we can do for you.\" This went on for a few years. Once I was able to refinance and it went without much fuss besides reverification of all finances.In the attempt to take out equity in the home, I was told they close on the loans in 1-2 weeks. They required a home appraisal, and the soonest someone could get out was 2.5 weeks away. During this time I verified all income and taxes, and awaited the appraisal. The meeting went without a hitch, mentioning I may just have to put exterior trim back on a window that was replaced. The appraisal took ~1 week to get, and mentioned they 'Recommended' I have my woodstove inspected. Rocketmortage told me when an appraiser says 'Recommend' it means 'Requires' and told me I would have to foot the bill for the inspection of the stove (although I was charged $965 for the appraisal that \"Required\" this). The soonest someone could inspect the stove was over 1 week away. During this time I questioned the rates and charges I had noticed on the paperwork. They added \"Discount Points\" on the sale to the sum of $1237.00, and after 2 days of attempting to get an answer as to what each point was worth in its percentage reduction on the rate, I concluded it would take 40 months to recoup the cost incurred. I asked to remove the points, as rates would probably drop and I would refinance within that timeframe. I was told if I did that, it would increase my rate by another 0.75% on top of the points-worth, because that changed my DTI. In essence I was stuck with spending the money on the discount points just to lose later.After a week of waiting for the inspection of the stove, I was told I needed to move it to provide clearances to the tile. I was out of town and had a friend move and reinstall the stove to the specifications provided, and photograph the measurements. I sent the photos to the inspector, and was ignored for 2 days before being told it actually needed to be moved to different measures, although no one would be around now to move it. I would have to move it three days later when I returned. The window trim was requested just before this time, and the project was completed and photographed to detail, and proof provided to Rocketmortgage. I was told it would have to be photographed by the appraiser, and he would have to come back out to do so. This was scheduled 2.5 weeks away as the soonest it was possible. My patience ran thin, and it made no sense, as I run a construction company and this is our business. On a whim working with a great member of the company she thought we could potentially provide the underwriters with a letter stating how it was done and signed by those in the business. This was provided. Underwriters have now taken 1.5 weeks to review information, and were asked to expedite, and asked for status, and we have largely been ghosted and dragged on. Asked for status on Friday and Saturday, just to be told Monday that the letter needs another signature and date.I am not one to write reviews, ever. This I felt needed to be known that the company in question has such a lack of humanity they will do you no favors, help you zero, and it is truly about profits. If you want it to be easy, I have found this is far from it. I am currently at about 60 days waiting for this to close, and those at the top do not care one bit to move things along, regardless of your situation.I began using Rocketmortgage due to them being the most affordable at the time. From my experiences in the last five years, I will be leaving them regardless of price, they are by far one of the worst companies to do business with. There are great people working for them, and I truly hope they leave and find a place that can allow them to help people like they desire, not just to be a cog for this dispenser of plutocratic red tape.

This was very deceptive and put us in a situation where we felt like we had no choice but to go through with these changed terms or risk losing out on the house.

This time around, not so much.The process at first seemed easy this time around.  Brad seemed nice and was helpful.  Unfortunately, things changed.  We decided not to purchase our mother's home and instead do a refinance in a trust created for our mother.  We got the information and then began the process on our end and things started to get ridiculous and frustrating.From the information that they kept asking for over and over, even after things had been provided multiple times.  I had to keep calling to tell Brad to let the team know that it had been provided.  Speaking to Brad (our contact there) also became more like speaking to a used car salesman around the middle of the process too.  We had specifically told him that we weren't going to be using family equity during the process at all yet it kept being put into the mix, including when we got paperwork and requests for information about said equity.  When I spoke to him after I received the request, his response was \"Oh, I thought we were going to use it\".  It was made VERY clear that it wasn't going to be used.  They had also given us rates based on the approximate appraised value that BRAD gave us.  When the official appraisal from their service came back, it was $25K HIGHER.  We were told that we would have to pay points to keep the rate at where we were told.  When questioned, Brad told us that it basically came down to the loan to value and it needed to be another $25K higher.  When I asked why we were told a lower rate when we a) had been basing it on his estimated value and b) he KNEW the amount of the loan from the start, he said there was nothing that could be done.  Yes there was..... tell us a rate based on the information provided from the beginning.While my mother was the owner of the trust, she is on SSI and makes under $2,000 a month.  As such, we were using the trustees incomes as we are all working.  When my mother made a purchase on a store credit card for $100, they nagged us for the statement as the card had just been opened.  They saw what the amount was and, when I said it's a $300k mortgage and we aren't using her credit as backing, it still took WEEKS to get resolved when I sent them the info.  Seriously?!?!?  It isn't even a blip compared to the amount we are borrowing and our incomes outside of my mother were what was being used.

There were things we were told that we found out after closing weren't factual. Like when our first payment would be due. We, also, found out after closing that the the checks that were issued to payoff for some of the accounts were short and we, the client, would be responsible to pay any overages!Also, after closing on the loan, they realized one of the payoffs of one of the accounts we were paying off had expired so they held ALL the other checks from being dispersed on time. This caused us to have to make some payments on accounts that we shouldn't have had to but the payments were due. These were accounts that were supposed to have been paid off by then.Now here we are just two weeks away from our first payment due and instead of being able to save up for it we're having to pay payments and overages on accounts that were supposed to have been paid off at the beginning of the month.We are definitely frustrated with something that could have been a lot smoother if Rocket Mortgage took better care of the client!

I regret that decision.It started by Rocket erroneously telling us that if we use one of their realtors we would have $10k back. We used their realtors instead of using one of our great realtor that had helped us in the past. The realtor that Rocket recommended was not good! Sometimes it felt they were not sure of what was going on and definitely felt they were not on our side.Then, later on the process (a few days before our closing date) we were informed that due to a mistake, Rocket could not give us the promised 10k. The agent assigned to our case said it was her mistake and that she gave us the wrong information and that unfortunately she would not be able to give us the promised 10k. She said she would make up to us and give us $5k. Because we were so close to the closing day we had no option but to accept it. Then, on the day before the closing that person assigned to our case called us to give the final numbers and then informed us that she wouldn\u2019t be able to give us $5k but $3k and that she gave us a discount on something that until today I have no idea what it was. That was so frustrating and I felt fooled or that we are stupid for trusting this company.Also, we had informed multiple times that we did not want to buy points in order to make our rate lower. On the day before our closing we were informed that we paid $17k to lower the rate (I was furious but again couldn\u2019t say anything because it was the day before our closing date, also it was like 6pm at night!)We also said that we would not like more than $20k back. This person again ignored us and gave us $50k back instead of using this money on the payment of the house.These things made my family and I not trust rocket anymore and we can\u2019t wait to refinance with another company!No one listened to us, it was all about the money!Also, the other agent assigned to us decided that it was not enough time to close on our house on the day stipulated on the contract, because the appraiser (request by Rocket) was late on delivering his report. If that would had happened we would had lost our deposit of $17k and probably lost our house. I had to call this guy crying and I desperately beg the him to not postpone the closing date. I explained that it was not our fault but the appraiser and finally he agreed to not postponed. Later on the closing we found out that this person was going to be out that day and probably that was why he didn\u2019t want to close on the day on the contract!It was so unfortunate and disappointing working with Rocket! I didn\u2019t expect that on the purchase of our house specially having a \u201crelationship\u201d with the company for so many years!We felt we were mislead on borrowing more money than necessary, buying points against our will and deceived into this \u201cuse our realtors and get some money back\u201d.

", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Rocket Denied Us Our Lender Credit 3 Days Before Closing ", "text": "We are purchasing a home and agreed to proceed with Rocket Mortgage based on an interest rate that included points purchased for $6,694, which were being covered by a $6,694 lender credit (LC). The loan included a shortage for 1.5% points. Other lenders had provided us with identical interest rates, but without the need to buy down the rate. Our agent provided the LC to bring their loan offer in-line with the competition. We explicitly told our agent that we did not use a Rocket Homes agent for our home purchase, but they assured us that the LC would be applied regardless due to management approval. Closing was scheduled for 2.5 weeks later. We received a Loan Estimate a week later that removed the LC. When questioned on the change, our agent assured us it was a technical issue that would be resolved. 6 days later, we received another updated Estimate that removed both the shortage and the LC. I flagged the issue again for Rocket but they didn't inform us until a week before closing that the LC was intentionally removed by their underwriters, due to the fact we didn't use a Rocket Homes agent, but they assured us they were working on a solution. 3 days before closing the agent finally came clean and told us Rocket would not honor the original terms of our agreement. The agent admitted they attempted to \"sneak [the lender credit] past\" underwriting, which management confirmed was not possible. We could either accept the shortage credit or the LC, but not both. Throughout this process the agent routinely failed to respond to calls and texts requesting to discuss the issue. As of closing, Rocket has acknowledged all of these events took place and that our original terms were approved by the capital markets team, but they refused to honor this approval because of their own agent's deception. Our options were to proceed with Rocket without the promised credit or lose the home. I've seen other posts discussing similar behavior so it appears to be a patter to pull in clients.

My journey with Rocket Mortgage turned into an absolute nightmare, leaving me frustrated and utterly disappointed. I was initially attracted by their slick advertising and promises of a hassle-free, efficient mortgage process. However, the reality was far from what was promised.First and foremost, the communication was horrendous. I was passed around from one representative to another, each time having to re-explain my situation. It was as if my file was lost in a black hole, with little to no updates unless I bombarded them with calls and emails. And even then, the information given was contradictory, leaving me confused about the status of my application.The lack of transparency was appalling. Hidden fees started to emerge out of nowhere, significantly increasing the cost beyond what was initially discussed. It was like a bad magic show where every trick was designed to make more money disappear from my pocket. The final closing costs were shockingly higher than the Good Faith Estimate, which was a bitter pill to swallow.Furthermore, the processing time was painfully slow. What was advertised as a rocket-speed process turned out to be more like a bicycle with flat tires. Constant need for unnecessary documentation became the norm, not the exception, causing significant stress until my final hours of closing. I have been faithful in my patience of processes because with my numerous years of being a government employee but this process was a test of my faith. My company Lockheed Martin referred them and this felt like a betrayal, considering the amount of time and energy I had invested in this process. In conclusion, my experience with Rocket Mortgage was far from the fast, friendly, and straightforward process they advertise. It was a sequence of mismanaged steps, lack of transparency, and utter disregard for the customer's time and money.

The processor assigned to our case did not show much care to our case and made multiple mistakes. Her phone calls seems rushed every time, and it felt like we were just an item on her daily to-do list. She asked us multiple times for the same task items that we advised her on, and she didn\u2019t understand what we were telling her. She reached out to our realtor for information, but when our realtor ask for clarifying details the processor forgot to send a reply for over a week and we had to call her to get the information moving along.2. Whoever sent information to the appraiser third party was not sending the correct information or enough information. We were purchasing a home over 4 states away from the house we were purchasing, so we had very limited information and access to the property. We advised rocket mortgage to contact and work with the builder and our realtor, which they had all the contact information for. The first appraiser called us, the BUYER, to ask for access to the property. Not only did we not have access to the property that day or the next day. Not only were we 4 states away, we were the buyers and couldn\u2019t get access to the new construction. Then the appraiser did not even know it was a new construction, Rocket Mortgage failed to convey this information. The first appraisal was cancelled as the appraiser wanted the house to be fully complete. We had to work with processor again to get another appraisal order, which AGAIN they called THE BUYERS not the realtor, or the builder to get access to the property. The mix up on the appraisal was a massive headache and had us calling the other parties in the process multiple times to get the appraisal on track.3. When it came to finalizing the loan numbers, we had not heard from the loan officer once we were passed off to the processor unless we reached out. We received multiple new disclosures in our rocket mortgage account that contained the incorrect and/or incomplete information. The new disclosures gave us absolutely no comfort about where the loan stood, or what our final numbers would look like. We were advised by the loan officer multiple times to just not look at the new disclosures that go out until the final one as they are incorrect\u2026.I don\u2019t understand why the system would continually send out disclosures that are incorrect and misleading.4. When we were sent the closing specialist, again it felt like just a person that wanted to check the box on the to do\u2019s. The experience was not personal or comforting at all. When making a large purchase it is VERY uncomfortable when we get a call and the individuals barely know our names. Then the starting throwing out numbers that don\u2019t align to what we were just told the day before by the loan officer.5. Rocket Mortgage was given the CORRECT tax number by the closing attorney and they complete ignored the amount. They used their third party who did not understand the tax laws for the area, and completely missed a credit that would apply to our primary residence. The value Rocket Mortgage wanted to use for the tax number was 2.5x larger than it actually should have been. This would have increased our closing close by over $4,000 and our monthly payments by $400. I called and had the loan officer check the number, but was informed it looked correct. I pushed back again and provided the tax law credit information and FINALLY it was corrected before closing. The buyer should not have to deal with these headaches when making a major purchase.6. We were going to get a credit of $5,000 from the builders loan company. We were told very straight forward that rocket mortgage could beat that and give us $8,000. When it came down to the end I honestly don\u2019t feel were given the credit we were PROMISED and we basically felt cheated. The loan officer showed us a screenshot of how the credit is being applied and I could basically see the credit in the back end\u2026not on the closing disclosure. The closing specialist informed us of completely different numbers for the credits and I don\u2019t feel we got our credit. It honestly felt like Rocket Mortgage increased the costs somewhere else in the closing process to balance out the credit were owed so we wouldn\u2019t notice that we didn\u2019t get our full credit.

Because of this and multiple other delays, where every time members of my \"closing team\" -- a different person each time, with a different requirement for closing each time, none of whom had spoken to each other, or who gave a consistent message -- continued to contradict each other, my loan was delayed by months, when that timeframe was harmful to my personal economic plan. Thankfully, I found the error on this loan that was supposed to have been fixed the first time, before actually closing the loan, and corrected it. The gentleman who closed the loan was kind and cordial, but when I had questions about some of the documentation, there were questions he wasn't allowed to answer per company policy. There should be no limitations on what questions can be asked about a loan from the notary. If they do not know, that is one thing, but to be directed from the company, not to explain certain aspects of the loan, is unacceptable. I will not be using this company again.

Although he said he would be willing to communicate with text or phone I often received an email and I didn\u2019t get notification but my husband did. I found this very frustrating. Next, your fees were a moving target.  These changed I believe 5x during our two month long very frustrating process with your company. I did understand that the fee would go up when the mortgage went up so the initial fee and one change I expected.  Our appraisal came back for more, congrats to us but then all of a sudden without notice your team tried to add an additional adjoining parcel to the mortgage even though it wasn\u2019t part of the original deal.

Loss of documentation and multiple people calling for the same items. I received a complaint from my land contract holder in which they informed me of the information sent over what day they sent it and it got lost with your title company after receiving a verbal communication saying they received it. Process was not at all smooth with the title company.. I had a land contract this land contract was between the land holder and my husband and I. For some reason the title company continued to ask for paperwork on my husband company so they could prepare a deed to move title from our company to us personally. NO WHERE WAS THIS A THING but just stopped our progress. I spoke at least three times with your banker Sean saying this item shouldn\u2019t be part of this deal. My husband is a sole proprietor of a business, and we never have put land in his businesses name.  Therefore no deed should be required this wasted our time. On the day closing, the fees were increased again and at that point, I was on vacation and if it did not close on that particular day, my intention was to start the process over again with another company as not one person that I dealt with really knew what was going on. Your employees are not educated in title, customer service, and clarity.   After losing a whole day of my vacation, I think we finally closed by 8 o\u2019clock that evening wasting a whole day that I paid to be with my family and I was stuck in a room fighting with your uploading technology, getting the proper fees and overall complete chaos on your part.

Finally, we talked to our broker and we understood that if we did not close the following day the seller might back out. We reluctantly agreed. The next day Rocket Mortgage informed us we would not be receiving the $2k check. We were furious, but had no options and nobody would help us.

The day I went to inspect the house I was informed of numerous issues and yes I could have walked away however, my agent convinced me that the issues were not as bad as the inspector stated in his report. My closing day right before I walked in I received a call from RM telling me they had not yet verified my employment.  Now, what in the Sam Hell do you mean you haven't verified my employment I thought. Upset and angry stressed and losing my mind I walked in the place to see everyone and as I made a call or two to my director to straighten out this mess before I signed my life away. I was given 2 receipts of the sewer line being repaired and the roof being replaced however as I googled the names of the ppl on the receipt I stumbled upon a bunch of nobody's listed so now I'm looking at the seller like where did you get these ppl who done the repairs from bcuz they're not on Google. OK realtor asked me did I call knowing good n darn well I didn't sitting right next to him which made me feel some type of way about him. So looking and reading over I ask again who are the ppl and how do I verify the work was done by licensed contractors tot he seller. The experience I experienced with Rocket was not what I expected. After, closing I got a call from the lender telling me the check didn't clear the bank because the money I made from the first employer prior to my current employer wasn't being counted so things are going to have to change bcuz the person who apparently verified my employment said I started in January while training rather than my initial start date causing more confusion. Not that the things that were supposed to be repaired upon me closing was not completed as said and I blame my realtor for not being in my best interest but only having his interest at heart. So do I recommend Rocket I did initially but I don't now. I wish I can say otherwise but I can't.

Rocket Mortgage Flagged my review and\u2026", "text": "Rocket Mortgage Flagged my review and took it down because they didn't think it was based on a genuine experience. But I am here to repost and prove that my experience is as accurate as it can be.Rocket Mortgage is a loan company, after all, so I expected them to prioritize their profits at the expense of consumers. However, I didn't expect they would hide important information and get away with it. They take advantage of the fact that most people don't have enough money to achieve their goals on their own and exploit people's needs and dreams. People can be naive in the process. We were!My husband and I worked with Brian Leach from Rocket Mortgage for months. Using our lifetime savings, we entered on the search of our 1st investment property. Our closing was on Friday, October 6, 2023. After reviewing our breakdown, we noticed we still need to get the money for closing we had arranged with the seller. We had negotiated with the seller to receive $5,000 out of the total amount of the house, and we contacted Brian to let him know about it on 9/12/23. He suggested that we take the money at closing instead of the selling price, which at the time made sense because we were supposed to receive it at closing, so we should have to get it out of pocket. However, we only received $3,100 instead of the 5k.When we contacted Brian, he apologized and said he thought we knew about the cap. However, He never explained anything about a CAP. As a matter of fact, his calculations were always based on $5,000 . We are highly disappointed because this significantly impacted our renovation budget, which went from $5,000 to $3,100. This is a variance of $1,900, and it is hurting our financial situation.We had no choice but to close with RM because the issues arose two days before closing when they sent us the final breakdown. Unfortunately, they waited until the end to show us the real numbers. The closing was time-sensitive, and we were too deep in the process with RM to back out. We had to make a tough decision to either continue with them or potentially lose the house, more money, and time. The whole process was frustrating and costly, both financially and emotionally.We are disappointed that this happy moment has been turned into a stressful situation. We do not recommend Rocket Mortgage as a bank, as they are playing with people's life savings and causing unnecessary stress and disappointment. It is different from returning an item to Walmart - this is a significant investment, and it is unfair to treat it carelessly.We contacted many people at Rocket Mortgage, asking for help and clarification, with no luck. Some of them for not to list everyone. Karmina Bolton, Executive Resolution Advocate. she said this: \"I attempted to call you however, the line went straight to voicemail without ringing. We are at a max of 2% for the seller concessions and we cannot add any additional credits. While the seller offered $5,000.00, we can only apply up to $3,100.00. The max of $3,100.00 was applied to this loan where it can be applied to. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you\"Shannon Porath, Presidents Club Purchase specialist (the best of all of them. At least she was responsive. She put us in contact with Karmina)10/5 arrived, and nobody helped us.  Rocket Mortgage promises complete satisfaction for their clients during the entire process. However, I am unsatisfied.We're feeling pressured by Rocket Mortgage to move forward with their process, as they transferred us from person to person. This caused our family to lose $1900, among other things. They waited until the last minute to spring this on us, knowing we were in a tough spot. The decision to proceed or back out is solely up to us, but unfortunately, backing out would result in more loss than gain. It's a difficult position, and Rocket Mortgage had us trapped.It is unfair, and I would hate for anyone else to go through this. I would never recommend this company to anyone. It is a scam.My husband and I have been experiencing a lot of frustration and stress because Rocket Mortgage failed to deliver on their promises. This has caused disagreements between us as I wanted to switch to a different company while he still wanted to stick with RM. This situation is a nightmare.

This time I was quoted an estimate of a mortgage of 843.00 by the time it was done it was up to 971.00 a big difference. I gave all the information that I was asked for on the 5sep. The mortgage just set and set and never moved, from the first step, every time I called the recording said his team, would be glad to help me, but when I called the number it automatically trsfed me to my mortgage broker since he was the one handling the loan. I finally called another 800 number and explained what the problem was, they said someone would call me by 830pm. But i also was experiencing every time I called and left a message, the rocket mortgage would call my phone and hang up, it showed as registered, but when I picked up no one was there, I would call back and the record would show that my mortgage broker had tried to call me and no answer. I finally called and asked for a supervisor and no one ever called me either. Finally I called and asked to speak to a manger and they put Mr Colin's name and he called, he then told me that my debt to ratio was too high, I asked why didnt the other person call and tell me that, he also said I had to include my husband's on  name on the loan because my bills were too high, he gave me a list of bills that needed to be paid, some were already paid, but they were on still on my credit record, I went round and round with that scene. I sent an Amazon bill that showed I owed 84.95, I paid that, then it showed I owed 19.24 I paid, that one the last day before closing now they said I owed Amazon 307.00 and wanted to include that in the loan, when it was 19,24 I was willing to let that be included, but 307.00 I was not. I send Amazon bill after bill showing a balance of zero from the 84.95 to the 19.24 to the zero. After going around and around then an agent said it was not the same account number why didnt someone notice this on the many times that I sent the Amazon bills I could have explained that I received a new card, it was like they had new people working. Also I sent a bill showing  zero balance and they couldn't accept it because it didnt have Shirley on it, even though it was the same account that I had been sending all along, and some of them had Shirley. I really started to believe that something sinister was going on, also the original amount I was to borrower kept going up and up, it finally came to 90,000.00 then I thought maybe that wasn't enough, daily it kept changing I owed, I was getting a refund. Also through this whole process the amount that I owed to HUD was still going up. Then finally they kept saying they were waiting for HUD to answer their call for a payoff quote. On a Friday night I found out they could never have gotten a payoff quote without me giving HUD the approval to release the information to them, no one called about that, they just kept waiting for a response from HUD, I said could I call them the agent said most of the time they reply when the borrower calls them, that is because the mortgage company can't a payoff without me signing a release, no one knew this, I'm sure this is not the first time you have dealt with HUD. Also the request for a payoff must be in writing, not through a telephone call. So if I had not taken the initiative I would have still been waiting some more. Finally it was done and I closed that went with no problems I received my refund of 106.00 immediately and I have checked with HUD and they have received their check.

This same person also  called the seller regarding a document that the seller didn't even existed because it was the attorneys responsibility to handle. Then over the phone this contact person proceeded to tell the seller that if she didn't submit that document, she might as well sell it to someone else. So after that conversation the seller thought we were uninterested and almost backed out.After the seller and I reconciled and decided to continue the closing process, we had to push back the closing date two different times due to negligence of both the lending and title work sides of it.On signing day, all parties and legal representatives met at an office and signed all the paperwork within 30 minutes. Everyone in the room received a email saying the closing was complete because all documents were signed. Not even seven MINUTES later, the seller, the signing agent, and I all received NEW closing disclosure documents to sign. Our signing agent called to see what was going on and found out that Rocket Mortgage/Amrock completely missed tax documents (which should have been looked at two months prior). We waited THREE hours for the company to review and during that time we received ANOTHER closing disclosure. Our closing costs increased by almost FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS - AFTER we signed our ORIGINAL closing disclosure (that doesn\u2019t really seem legal to me\u2026)We were grateful that the legal representatives and our signing agent were able to stay during this mess because otherwise we would not have been able to sign and close on our house.

We were stressed that the contracts and agreements would be void if they didn't have the remaining funds by a certain date and we were never reassured for that concern.

I saw a commercial for the one plus program and thought , \"hey maybe I can finally become a homeowner!\"  I filled out the information online and went through the process. I was reached out by Dustin who genuinely is an awesome human being. I was told I didn't qualify for one plus because my credit score was too low. So it took two months or so to build my credit up to a 720.  During the process of building my credit, I found the perfect home for my family and I. I started picking up a ton of overtime to save enough money just in case. The entire time of this process the Rocket team said my DP would be $8600+ then at the last month of the process it changed to $9600+. I was told after the second time of applying for the one plus program that I made too much money \ud83d\ude11. So I raised my credit from working a bunch of ot to pay off my debt to be denied a second time. Whatever right I got an FHA loan it's 3.5% down right? No. In the very end on the last day my lawyers office calls to tell me that Rocket messed up the entirety of the loan. The numbers weren't correct. And I'd now need $14,800+ to close. How does it jump $5000+ more? How did no one catch that the number weren't correct?? Who approved the loan for me based off of incorrect information?? And since closing not one person has reached out to me to explain why it jumped $5000+ more dollars off of a 3.5% DP with $5000 sellers commission plus 1.5% closing cost covered by rocket plus $1500 extra for a refrigerator and stove that I now cannot afford. I only have $12,500 in the bank. My lawyer graciously covered the difference but now I owe him almost $2000. Got a house I have no extra money for and all my closing agent says is, \" your lawyer could have added extra fees\". No Debbie you messed up the numbers!! I was sitting in the office when you called and the paralegal had you on speaker phone and told you you messed up a difference of $5,000!! And your response was oh ok. That's a huge difference in a down payment. I'm still livid. The fact no one has reached out is just the icing on the cake.

We had negotiated with the seller to receive $5,000 back for closing, and we contacted Brian on 9/12/23 to help us choose the best option for receiving the money. He suggested that we take the money at closing instead of of the total amoung, which at time made sense for us. However, we are only receiving $3,100 instead of the promised $5,000. When we contacted Brian, he apologized and said that he thought we knew about the cap. However, we received an email from him that did not explain anything about the cap, neither he talked about it when we ask about the options and his calculations showed $5,000 at closing on his email. We are extremely disappointed because this significantly impacted our renovation budget, which went from $5,000 to $3,100. This is a variance of $1,900, and it is hurting our financial situation.

No one at Rocket understands 1031 exchanges. And I mean no one. We had to have our QI, Qualified Intermediary, make call after call with the loan officer, his manager, his director to make the loan happen. They flatly refused to have their underwriters call the QI directly. It was clear that the info they got about 1031 exchanges was from a Google blog search. Everyone acted like complete amateurs throughout the process.The loan officer promised 1.5% back in lender credits. What he failed to mention was that the discount point would fluctuate throughout the process from 2.625% to over 3%. Then if they take 1.5% off the higher percentage, then they claimed they were giving us close to 1.5% off, uh, but not quite.Original close date was supposed to be Sept 8, then we had to change it to Sept 13 and they acted like they didn't have to look at it until the 13th. Then we had to delay it again until Sept 15. Then to make any changes to what they really offered as 1.5% lender credits would have triggered another delay in closing and we could have lost our $10,000 earnest money. Mind you, our loan officer originally told us that Rocket could close within 21 days of the start of the loan process. It was nowhere close to that. Their appraiser was a joke too, but you can't bring in your own appraiser - bank rules. The appraiser gave no value for a partially above ground pool even though there was a full deck and fence around the pool with a covered deck area. They act like an \"above ground pool\" could be \"easily removed\". Not with a full deck around it!! And because the appraised value came in low, they wanted us to pay the difference even though we were already putting nearly 40% down. Of course, disputing the appraisal or asking for another appraisal to be done would have risked another delay in closing. It was a nightmare. I could go on and on about what a horrible experience it was. Don't believe their rating scores - they should be much lower.

This sudden change caused delays and complications that could have been avoided with better attention to detail from the bank's staff.Moreover, we discovered on the day of closing that they had also misspelled my name. This was an unacceptable oversight on the bank's part, as it is crucial for all details to be accurate and correct in such an important process as home acquisition.Another negative aspect is that the bank charges a fee for processing the loan. This is something I have never experienced with any other bank. I find it surprising that I am being charged for applying for a loan, and I consider it an unethical practice.Additionally, I felt pressured by the fact that if we decided not to proceed with the loan with them, we would lose the money we had already invested in the process.

No answer there either. \"There's no set time for when the processing team reaches out to to a client for help with verification.\" I firmly believe if I hadn't followed up myself, I would still be waiting.

I waited about 3.5 then emailed my banker. She was told there was a delay but couldn\u2019t figure out why. Later that day, she said they were trying to verify my condo association\u2019s insurance. I had given them the community manager\u2019s name and after two more days of waiting, I emailed her myself and got a response in 5 minutes. The processing team clearly never contacted her. She gave me an email address they could use to request the info and I forwarded it to my banker. Two days later I heard nothing so I called the 800 number and got someone from the processing team who claimed the email I received was a bad address. I hung up and emailed myself and the email went through. So I called again and said the email was fine so what was the problem? No answer. Because there was no issue. The team just wasn\u2019t doing any work on my loan.Finally two days later, someone calls because they need to verify my own condo insurance. I sent that and she finally got me ready to close. I find out that the interest rate that was locked in actually expired while I was waiting for the processing team and the lower one was no good. Their inaction cost me money and there was nothing I could do or I would forfeit the $500, plus I needed my hvac replaced. They wouldn\u2019t even give me any closing credit to compensate.

I was able to speak to another representative about the inspection and he stated that all VA loans require it. So it was a shock that I wasn\u2019t informed earlier about it. Also, I was told that we could close on the first week of May. Then the rep who I literally just met gave me a closing date of May 8th and settlement date of May 12th.

If timing didn\u2019t play a factor in the scenario I would\u2019ve switched and went with Loan Depot. They gave me everything upfront and didn\u2019t lie about it to get my business. So much for closing the first week of May. Not only did I get the run around from one of their loan officers. But, the second one that was supposed to better took about as much time as the first one.

Oh and I forgot to add that after the long drawn out process they didn\u2019t even give me any Lender Credits. Not that surprising.

Also, I refinanced my home twice with Quicken loans back in the day. Maybe they should take a page out of their old book. Because the only thing \u201cRocket\u201d that this resembled was the one at the Smithsonian. Lastly, when I asked if I would be receiving any Lender Credit. The lender told me that \u201cThere have been no additional lender credits added at this time now that closing has been scheduled. There are a total of $838 in lender credits already applied to the final figures\u201d. So after the \u201cso-called\u201d settlement the first week of May didn\u2019t workout. Then May 8th didn\u2019t workout. Then May 12th didn\u2019t workout. Then June 3rd didn\u2019t workout. We now arrive at June 7th and the best that could be done is $838. My final numbers from the refinance dropped $1,000. At this point, I could\u2019ve paid it.

Initially the website had my loan set at $100,000 less than the approval on my letter, which I had to call Derek to fix. I talked to Alex one time and he has ghosted me for a month after promising to walk homes for us virtually because we are buying out of state. Alex told me to sign up on a different search engine then Rocket Mortgage so it is 'more efficient and updated', however as we know, you want us to go through Rocket Mortgage so we can collect tokens for doing research and homework like a child to give a better closing cost that you actually could just give the buyer instead of doing award-based activities to make them feel better about a purchase! Still I tried to do everything I was told like watching videos and gaining points after taking quizzes for a better closing cost while simultaneously looking through a different portal for Alex saving homes he was supposed to follow up on. Three weeks has gone buy with nothing from Alex but his automated search engine (Not Rocket's) that sends me homes that are not even in my criteria!    So I tried to talk to Derek Radel about what house qualifies since after doing my own research on manufactured homes (most of the only homes populating) are on unimproved roads that most FHA and conventional loans won't finance, they have to be 1975 or newer and they have to be permenant homes (which is really hard with manufactured homes to be considered). There are HUD plates that need to be looked for to find out if qualification can take place on any age manufactured homes.   Because Alex wasn't getting back to me about my questions, Derek said to send me over any prospective house and he could research and make sure they were able to qualify. I sent him two properties with MLS and he said those 'look good' and quoted the text found at the bottom of any home search engine about it being cash or conventional. I waited for them to get back to me and when I complained that Andrew went 'Radio Silent' he told me all I had to do was to give him, Derek the listings and he would check them out. I told him I sent him two listings and I am the one doing all the research here. I was told I could trust these individuals to find me an out-of-state home and  here I can't trust them to get back to me. I told him I talked to other list realtors and they don't want to work with Rocket at all and warned me my pre-approval was not legit. Derek told me you don't get to be as big as Rocket if you hand out fake approvals! I replied that Rocket has changed it's name so it does not mean biggest is always best. Today, he said he is insulted and is not going to work with me anymore because he stopped texting me and I texted him that he seems to be \"ghosting me\" which has enraged him so much he is done with me! He did nothing and neither did any of the three agents I got paired with. This seems like a scam if not just a waste of my time and watching houses I love just get snatched up! Of course Derek does this over Memorial weekend   so we can't get a hold of anyone (not like I could before). I have left messages with Chris Ray, head of realtors with no follow up. This has been my worst nightmare! My husband has to relocate for his job and this was time sensitive which I told everyone.

The price we were given was a bit higher than we expected; however, the agent informed us that there was a PMI on the loan.

Furthermore, he said that if we wanted to get this off sooner, that all we needed to do was increase the value of our home to meet the criteria. We put at least 20k into the home and then called back. The lady made a list of the improvements and informed us that all we needed was to allow them to come do their own appraisal and we'd be good to go, PMI free. I needed a little time to get the fee together that they asked for and when I called back, I was informed that my loan was suddenly sold to another company... I was assured absolutely nothing would change and that the list we made would be forwarded over to seamlessly complete the process. Upon speaking to the new company, they did receive the list; however, they have different policies and now I would only be able to take off the PMI if I paid over 22k to my principal balance. We would have used the 20k we put into the house IF WE WERE NOT LIED TO. Instead, we are stuck struggling with a payment that is higher than promised until God knows when.

I have worked on both the title and the lender side as a closer, document reviewer, etc. I was around when the regulations swithed from HUD to CD, and have written several training guides for various companies - I know the regulations and how they can be interpreted. It is 9/9/22 and we have been working on this since the second week of July 2022. I am in the final stages of a cash out refi ( divorce buyout) , hopefully closing soon and this process has been the worst possible excuse for the way customers should be treated. From the very beginning, both my ex husband and I were in contact with 2 different loan officers at Rocket, who we received awful communication. Texts, calls and emails went unanswered for days at a time. This was after they pulled our credit of course and so we wanted to work it out with them. Finally my ex cancelled his application all together, and I should have done the same. Once I confronted my LO about her inattentiveness, she did do a much better job of communicating with me and giving me updates. Moving forward, my loan passed hands quite a few times (obviously- I know this is how it works), however, i'd send several emails and texts to the person that I had last spoken to as my contact, only to find out DAYS later that I needed to speak with someone else. They never reached out and I always had to go track down updates. I run my own business now and told Rocket employees no less that 20 TIMES that I am not to be called - that they need to email me or text me. I can scheduled a call if is needed. They have continued to call me constantly, and then complain to me that I haven't done my part when they aren't communicating in the way that I specified. As we were getting closer to my lock expiring, I was made aware that additional documents would be needed from me - on a thursday, ten days before my lock expired. These are documents that pertained to a transaction made three weeks prior that was  overseen by my loan officer. She never requested documentation. I had to make a physical trip to the bank to get statements amid my busy schedule, and when i sent the docs over and requested that UW be expedited, as my lock was about to expire, the customer care specialist told me that, he couldn't promise anything. There was no sense of urgency and there hasn't been throughout this whole ordeal. Irritated, at this point, I requested to speak with his supervisor and he told me that he was the best person to help me, and would not provide me with his superior's information. When we spoke the following Tuesday, he told me that my lock had already expired! So they had to extend it. Rocket enjoys interpreting the regs in their own way. I am now being told that I can't close on the earliest available day (per regulations) becuase it's not the earliest date in their system. I explained that I hadn't made a mortgage payment and that my ex husband's credit would be affected if we didn't close asap, and again - no sense of urgency. To add to this entire mess, they're now telling me that they never were aware that I was using my own notary to close and that that would require special permission - which could take up to 48 hours. The request for that was supposed to be submitted yesterday but I was just told that it may not come back until Monday (it's Friday now), as it has not been submitted yet. Furthermore, when I talk to title about it, it's a game of he said-she said. Rocket says it's up to title and title says its up to Rocket. Ultimately, this company is terrible.

This could have easily been done by our current lender at the time so they weren't really beating the offer.

Way too long!We got a referral from a close family member to contact Rocket Mortgage to do a VA refinance.  From the very beginning we began to notice signs that should have given us a small clue of what we would go through doing the VA refinance and we are stunned to see how customers are not given the quality of care as a customer would receive when dealing with a local mortgage company.  Local companies give customers respect and care that we never received from Rocket Mortgage.  We have been providing documents to rocket mortgage and we receive duplicate requests for documents that was already provided.   As a Customer dealing with your company has become a complete nightmare and after speaking to my district VA loans Center we were informed that customers like us get unfavorable services from your company because you are so big and the care and commitment isn't given to customers like us.  We were surprised that the VA loan center had had numerous complaints about Rocket Mortgage with the same issues.  It's quite disgusting to know us veterans fight for those of you and your freedom and we get continously told incorrect information because there are too many hands in our loan process and it seems our experience with Rocket Mortgage is ignored and the care we should have received has been ignored as well as our continued complaints.  This loan should have been closed by now had your company honestly cared about us and eliminated errors and researched documents already provided to avoid duplicate document requests.   Really, This process is all about your company and making sure all your i's are dotted and your t's are crossed regardless of what you put the customer through. This is such an outrageous and Unbelievable worst experience we have ever had.  We purchased our house and closed in 3 weeks never experiencing such a clown operation that we have had go through with Rocket Mortgage. Thanks again for the nightmare.  I really hope that this email and our past history and complaints is seen by upper management just so another potential customer doesn't experience what we did.  Rocket Mortgage employees are not experienced enough to answer questions or concerns and when you get transferred to other employees,  they make promises to return your call or do follow up but you never get it.

For the current loan we are trying to close we are selling our current house and moving to another, both loans are with Quicken and the same Title company. We closed on the house we are selling without issue, and the buyers gave us a 5 day grace period. We were scheduled to close on the new house 3 days later. Both the title company and Rocket Mortgage told me everything was good to go. However, an hour before I was supposed to go in to sign, the title company told us that Rocket had sent the closing documents with the wrong date. The title company had corrected them two days prior and the person handling the loan for Quicken had told them that the correction was made, but it wasn't. This is when our nightmare started. The agent handling our closing was 'out for the day' and nobody knew who was supposed to replace her. We wasted a lot of time because Rocket initially blamed the title company, because they didn't have access to the missing agents files and correspondence. Once we forwarded them the emails between the title company and their agent, they admitted it was their error, but then said that they couldn't fix the problem because they had already wired the funds for the close, and their system wouldn't permit them to reissue documents after the funds were wired. They insisted that the title company would have to return the funds, and that they couldn't do anything about reissuing the correct documents and redoing the wire until the return wire clears. Meanwhile the seller of our new house gave us an extra day to close, but if Quicken can't figure out how to override their computer systems to correct their own error in time, we'll lose the new house. Housing prices in our area have risen significantly since we went under contract for the new house, and the builder could now sell at a higher price. We live in a pretty rural area with a hot housing market. There are no short-term rentals, no available storage facilities within a 100 mile radius, and very little inventory in the housing market, with many properties going for cash. I would never have closed on our old home if I thought there was the slightest thing not ready to go on the new home. The women we've been dealing with who are trying to correct the error are empathetic and seem to be genuinely trying to correct the error before we lose the new home. However, I was transferred to a Resolution Advocate who basically told us that they'll try to fix it, but just because the error is Rocket's doesn't mean they're responsible for fixing it in a timely manner and that we should prepare to be homeless and that is our problem. He almost seemed to enjoy telling us that. I'll update if the problem gets fixed before we lose the new house.Update: Rocket was able to correct the clerical error by yesterday afternoon, and with the support of our local community, the seller was persuaded to let us close late. We lost our movers, and are dealing with a plethora of safety and logistical hurdles, but will ultimately be okay. We are very grateful to the team of managers and technical folks who worked incredibly hard to correct the problems with their computer systems. They were kind, empathetic, and kept us updated on their efforts, which helped us with negotiating locally on our side. From what I've been told by folks in the industry, this is a very rare and unusual type of clerical error. The problem with heavily controlled and computerized systems, is that when they work they're more efficient, but when you have an outlier clerical error like this, it can be much harder to fix rapidly.Given that a lot of folks at Quicken did work extremely hard to salvage the situation, I'd be willing to write this off as an anomaly and change my rating. However, the conversation with Mr. Warner made it quite clear that had they not been able to correct their error before we lost the new house, that they intended to walk away and abandon us. Given the housing and rental market here, if we'd dropped out of the home owner's market temporarily, we would not have been able to rejoin under current market conditions. This would have had a long-term impact on our family's financial, housing, education, and employment stability. It's terrifying to think how close we came to that scenario, due to something completely outside of our control. Rocket's motto is \"We're with you through closing - every client - every time - no exceptions - no excuses.\" They played it every time they put me on hold.

Rocket Motgage Quicken Loans is the worse company to deal with.  Their practices mess with consumer's credit.  I had an issue 3 years ago and just had another issue this week.  For convenience I have impound accounts that pay the taxes and insurance. I have automatic payments set up with my bank so every month a payment goes out.  The problem is with escrow accounts.  Every year or every other year the escrow usually changes because of increase taxes or insurance.  The problem is \"technically\" the payment is due on the 1st but they give you a \"grace period\" so many people set up a payment on the 5th or 6th to be sure your paycheck gets deposited.  The problem is when they change the escrow account and your payment is short they don't apply the payment to your principal and interest.  They hold the payment and send you a letter that says you have been turned over to the default team.  by the time you get the letter they will have charged you a late fee of $50 for the $100 shortage.  If you happen to be out of town or don't get the letter in time to pay the $100 plus the late fee and get it in by the 1st you get turned into collections and even though you have another payment that gets delivered on the 6th to make up for any shortage of the previous month, technically it is 6 days late, so they report a 30-day late payment to the credit bureaus. This affects consumer's credit over shady practices.  Just because you can do something doesn't mean that you should do something.I paid the $51.94 late fee and overfunded the escrow account so this doesn't happen again.  As a business owner and entrepreneur graduate, I really dislike companies that put so little value on their customers.  It is their choice and normally as consumers, we can choose to not do business with an establishment.  Unfortunately, we have no control over who our mortgages get sold to on the secondary market and we are forced to deal with companies that we would not normally deal with.  When they have the ability to affect your credit score it makes it even more dangerous.  If you flat out don't make your payment your credit will be affected and I understand that.  To not even get a courtesy call in this situation is bad business practice.  The company and I will have spent hours dealing with this when it could've been resolved with a 3-minute call.UPDATE: I called Mandi back and gave the company an opportunity to address their lack of customer service.  I was forwarded to two different people and several explanations the result was the same.  They claimed, \"it is our policy\".  I explained how flawed their policy is but they said there is nothing they can do about it.   Further proof of why doing business with Quicken Loans/ Rocket Mortgage is a bad idea.

Repeated phone calls at all times of the day trying to sell something that I question if they can actually deliver within a reasonable amount of time. Repeatedly asked for documents that have been submitted and resubmitted.  The documents are able to be seen from the website as submitted but some how the company reps cannot see this and continue to ask.  The best outcome came when I reached out to the Rocket Mortgage/Quicken Loans Board of Directors via email.  I received a response in about 8 hours.  Everything was handled and a closing scheduled like one would expect from a reputable company that has knowledge about customer services and creating / supporting a process that works and makes sense. As would be expected, access to the Board of Trustees emails is no longer visible (easy to find).  Great way to get feedback...thanks.  Clearly, there would be no need to reach out to someone at the board level if those at the customer service level communicated effectively and the process of reviewing and submitting documents addressed in a way that did not result in continued requests for the same information.  I have been working on this process since the first week in December and now, the 29th of January I am still being asked for docs that have been uploaded several times.  I even had the business office at my job supply docs. They too ran into into issues with quicken and had to resubmit, send repeated email, etc.The most frustrating part is that I knew that this would happen.  When I received the repeated chain of calls l expressed my lack of interest.  I explained my concern and provided some history regarding the last attempt at working with Rocket/Quicken.  The person on the line seemed okay and assured me that it would in no way be a difficult process and that he would be on top of everything.

The website is terrible, not user- friendly, and confusing, they do not call you back in a timely fashion. We submitted all paperwork right away but as the weeks went on we kept having to resubmit the same paperwork over and over. Just when it looked as if we needed to do nothing, and we\u2019re simply waiting for a closing date- a notification would be sent to resubmit paperwork again. This happened more than a few times. When we would call them we would never get a human, and then when we did get a callback it seemed they had no clue about what was holding up our refi. Ultimately, our loan was denied after 5 months because we failed to submit our paystub yet again. Then they re- instated us only to deny again for the same reason.

That's sort of my fault, but Jerry did work with it.  It wouldn't have been an issue if they had just given me the damn rate to begin with which is what the deceptive ad said I would be getting. Yes, you can give me a range without doing all the paperwork. You can ask for my credit score and give an approximate rate with tons of disclosures.Rocket Mortgage bates you with low rates and low fees, then when you get into the process, you find out that fees are 18 times what you saw in the deceptive ad and then of course the rate is 36% *higher* than the deceptive ad and I have a credit score in the 800s, thank you!

Your guess is as good as mine what it accomplishes, other than to annoy the customer. I've done this twice now. They asked me the same exact questions the second time. Lucky for me, I answered correct again.  God knows what might happen if you answered incorrectly.I have read many negative reviews here, where people have debt, and generally problematic mortgage scenarios. As stated in my first review, I have excellent credit, a loan to value ratio so attractive that the appraiser asked me why Rocket was appraising the house. The house is in a desirable area. The point being, there is nothing about this refi that should take this long, or require the extraordinary involvement on my part. I have zero debt, with exception to a very low mortgage, relative to the house value. No auto loans, no CC debt, no student loans, nothing.  Daily through the process, you will receive messages \"rocket has added an item to your to-do list, please login and review\". I have had 30+ tasks to date. Many absurd, some valid of course. My current item is to get the payoff on my current mortgage. Rocket is somewhat inept at doing anything for themselves. I have went to my local mortgage holders office six times in the past months to get things on Rockets behalf. Rocket actually made me submit to them a document from my mortgage company that proved I paid the mortgage for the past 12 months? Seems like that would be easily verifiable, as obviously, it would hit your credit report. Furthermore, you probably wouldn't be living at the house they just got an appraisal on if you didn't pay your mortgage for a year. Does the fact that they are asking me to get them a 30 day payoff mean that we are close to a close? I'm thinkin' probably not.

We sent everything in promptly as required.  From the start they kept asking us for the same things over and over.  And in July we got a payoff from the bank and then they couldn\u2019t set a closing date because they kept needing the same things over and over and then too much time would pass, and they would need another payoff.  Then there were at least 5 more payoff dates, but they wouldn\u2019t set a closing date.  \u201cOh, we need your bank statements again, ETC.  Closing costs kept escalating and then suddenly they needed us to have another $6,000 in the bank on top of closing.  They kept asking for statements from a 2nd mortgage.  We told them from the start there was no second mortgage.  Then they said we hadn\u2019t made our house payment.  We said again and again we didn\u2019t have a house payment, because the bank was waiting on closing as it was switching from a building loan to a house loan. AND IN FACT,  we had already settled that matter BEFORE the closing date was set.  So finally, they set a closing date and then AFTER setting a closing date they say, \u201cOh wait, we got a flag saying you haven\u2019t made your house payment.\u201d  The bank loan officer even talked to them and told them we didn\u2019t have one to make yet and were not behind.  So then it took them another 2 weeks and then they denied the loan, because they said we were behind on house payments that we didn\u2019t have.  This was the worst experience ever.  It took 6 MONTHS to get turned down. We had passed a final inspection. There was no communication between people there, so they kept having to ask stuff and ask for stuff over and over.  If it weren\u2019t for a guy named David that helped us, we\u2019d still be sitting here waiting.  He was very helpful and tried his best, but the underwriters were just horrible.

To make a long story short, I know they have some good reviews, but I see a lot of bad ones from people with the same issues.  They simply cannot handle anything besides a plain old basic run of the mill loan. They couldn't figure out that we didn't have house payments, that it was a construction loan, and we didn't have a home equity line of credit or a 2nd mortgage.  This was an FHA loan, and we were recently told by another loan place you can't get that type for what we were applying for-If you have a building loan and are switching  to a home loan,  with some other stuff that were particular to our loan circumstance.  We suspect that somewhere along the way, after we were months into this someone figured that out (we didn't know it- we're not loan experts) that they weren't supposed to do this kind of loan, and they waited until we hadn't made a house payment to the bank over 60 days, and then used a false flag to deny so no one got into any trouble that works there.

The appraisal listed it as a 2/2. I was told I didn't have enough value to refinance. They keep my $500. I had an appraisal for a Refinance (07/14/20) through Rocket / Rock Mortgage. The appraisal returned in less than 48 hours with multiple mistakes. I just finished investing $40,000 in to the house. We added a New Bedroom, A/C, Air Handler and ducks, New Roof, Electrical, Breaker box Breakers to receptacles and switches, New Gutters and Down Spouts and much more. My biggest issues was having my house devalued. I filed for a dispute (07/17/20). I was told to prepare why I felt this way and have examples. on (07/21/02) I spoke with Kyla for three hours. I went over multiple mistakes in the appraisal along with examples of homes in walking distance that had sold over the last few months. The appraiser listed 14 home in his search criteria. My house is a 3 / 2 and he listed 11 homes that were 2 / 2. The Three 3 / 2 homes were home that converted there garages into the 3 Bedroom. The other issue I had was his 14 homes he listed averaged $97,000. I was able to find well over 20 homes that had sold starting at $140,000 and going as high as $225,000,00. Yet he never listed one of them. The appraiser marked my appraisal saying I was listing my house for sale. That was yet another mistake. Since the appraisal I've received multiple calls from real estate agents wanting to buy my house. It come to my attention through conversations and an email the appeaser was suppressing prices in the neighborhood. In the last two years housing prices have going up do to a new Highway coming within miles of the area. The average sale time in the area and neighborhood is under three weeks. There is a team of real estate and contractors taking advantage of this. Rocket / Rock Financial sent my appraisal back to the appraiser to correct mistakes. The only change he made was making my home a 3 / 2 form a 2 / 2. Yet he never fixed the value to reflect the 3 / 2 or any of the upgrades. I handed him a list of upgrades and pertaining data. This appraiser is suspect. My dispute was passed on to Sean Xxxxxx in the Arizona office. I requested he not call late night, yet he did every time. Sean was always rude, disrespectful and inconsiderate. I have never been talked down to by anyone like he had. He told me there was nothing he could do even though he asked me to look up three more properties proving my home value. I had done more research than the appraiser. Yet Sean would not except my findings and closed my account stating the value of my home was not enough to refinance. I spent 30 days, multiple hours and $500.00 to be treated this way. There is Fraud going on in my neighborhood and Rocket / Rock Financial treated me like low life and gave total respect to the appraiser. I owned a coin grading business and I know everyone thought there coin was worth more then it was. I can tell you this, I'm not making this mistake with my house. By the way, The appraisers example houses included a home purchased buy the group for $55,000 and nine months later sold for $115,000. He didn't find any problem making that jump in value!I've been blow off by Rocket /Rock Financial for the last time. I reported them to the BBB, but that didn't matter.

I called her number the morning of 9/17, left a voicemail, 4-hours later called again (another voicemail), and at the end of the day finally got a return call.  When we spoke, I was looking for a firm date for moving this forward.  Her promises were hollow.  Her only timeline was, \"as soon as possible\".  As of this writing they have done nothing to move the refi forward.  She promised to call me with an update by noon today 9/18 (at the latest)... SUPRISE!  No call... Yes I did call her, and got.... her voicemail.Her offer was clearly not meant to assist us, but to make Rocket Mortgage not look so bad to everyone else reading these reviews.  It's just another game they're playing.  Nothing changed.   There is no end in sight.The stress was terrible and they don't seem to care.So this morning, we made the move.  We have contacted a local lender and it\u2019s a HUGE IMPROVEMENT!  We are already pre approved, new appraisal on Monday at 7am, and are targeted to close at the end of our 10-day waiting period.  Yes, that\u2019s right, at the end of this month.All I want at this point to is get reimbursed the $500 deposit we paid for the refinance since (by their own admission) they did not perform.  No one should have to pay for services that were never rendered (I'm pretty sure it's a law).

It was discovered I have mold staining on part of the wood in my attic. Now he told me I had to get this taken care of before closing.

He also refused to provide me any paperwork stating that it is a VA loan policy that mold be taken care of prior to closing.  Absolutely refused.  I told him I'd do my own research.  I spent thirty minutes and found something interesting.  According to my state laws and regulations I'm allowed to mitigate the mold myself. Then even if a contractor or myself mitigates this situation you would still need another inspection to verify the mold has been taken care of. So this handler decides to suspend my loan because I'm not currently doing anything with my loan.  He explained that when things sit too long that's what happens yet contradicted himself by saying it was a conversation that was had with his director and.... Then also let's me know that even if the mold is taken care of the loan would get suspended again because I'd have to sit on the home deed waiting for due process in order to get a sheriffs deed.  I literally asked him what the point was in dealing with the mold immediately if my loan was going to get suspended from waiting for a sheriffs deed.  I've asked several times for paperwork in regards to their processes, the VA regulations for loans, and underwriting information as there are always gray areas.

Today 9/3 I get a call asking for more information and to establish problems that may further push out closing. Now mind you, the reason the first date was pushed is because they didn\u2019t get their own title company involved soon enough to meet closing. No other reason. So now already past date they want to address other topics. In the start of the process we set out goals to keep closing costs down. We discussed for a good couple hours combined how those numbers would come out. We\u2019ve gone from $93 to $1400 as of today. Given how this has gone I\u2019d expect by next week it\u2019ll be $3000. Communication has been poor at best, I\u2019ve talked to 4 people each of which has not known vital pieces of information important to this process. I\u2019ve felt very pushed aside in this situation despite the fact it involves me putting myself in 6 digits of debt to them.

I received a call at 8:21 last night from the closing agent, they hadn't even left their last appt which was 30 minutes away, so they weren't coming. My closing was scheduled for 8:00. The sellers(who happen to be related to me) drove from Atlanta to Virginia just to do the closing. I've tried to speak with several people this morning to figure out what is happening and I haven't been given a straight answer. The only positive is the closing costs did get resolved closer to an original number around 500. Will update if I get a chance to actually close. I will also post this review on Amrock and Field Choice, LLC(traveling notary) as they are just as involved as Rocket.11/20/2020 Update:So luckly all has been quiet on the western front since closing.

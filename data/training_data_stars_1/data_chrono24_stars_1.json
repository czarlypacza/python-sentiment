If you\u2019re looking for peace of mind with your purchase, I strongly advise reconsidering Chrono24. They left me out in the cold with no support after I lost a significant amount of money.Dear Mediation Team,Thank you for your response. However, I would like to emphasize an important detail regarding the delivery issue. The post office has confirmed that the package weight when it arrived in South Africa differed significantly from the weight recorded upon reaching the Steelport post office. This discrepancy strongly suggests that the item was tampered with or stolen during transit.This experience raises concerns about the safety and reliability of using Chrono24, as it indicates a potential gap in the security of the shipping process.

Based on my research, I knew I would have to pay around \u20ac1,400 in VAT (21%) and customs duties of a maximum of 80 cents in Spain. After the watch arrived at Madrid airport, DHL informed me that I had to pay a customs fee of \u20ac300, a handling fee for customs, and a tax registration fee of \u20ac300. I was refused any attempts to get more precise information on how DHL calculates customs (contrary to EU regulations) and to independently clear the goods through customs. I have arranged the return shipment. Due to this intransparent buying process, it was the first and last watch I bought on Chrono24. I would not have purchased it if someone had told me before I had to add another 600 Euros. I wonder why this is allowed; I have never had such an intransparent e-commerce experience. It's not recommended for me, at least for purchases outside the EU.UPDATE to the reply of Chrono24: You haven't addressed the point of my complaint. Maybe next time, you should read my post carefully rather than just copy-paste text blocks. It was not about the payment of taxes and customs. This is a no-brainer. The complaint about your company is that the buying process is entirely intransparent in terms of fees on top of the VAT and customs. You clearly stated that I have to pay 1400 Euros VAT (correct) and about 50 Euros customs (not correct; it should have been 0,80 Euros based on the European regulation). What you have not made transparent is that DHL charges 300 Euros to declare customs plus an additional incorrect 300 Euros for customs, which they wanted to charge on my credit card.

The seller first said if I were to do that it would revoke his 1-year warranty. He then went offline for a week due to a trip in China.

What if a person without much watch knowledge to have not detected the replaced hands and have not started questioning the whole authentication process?Chrono24 is definitely encouraging scam, fraudulent sellers and never on the buyer\u2019s side.

The dealer offered no credible reason why the two items would be shipped separately (and the only reason I became aware was after the items were shipped!).

It was sent from the UK to Australia using Royal Mail International tracked service. The full tracking details were entered into the C24 website and were visible to all parties including C24. The watch was delivered in 7 days, but the C24 website still showed the delivery status as \u201c awaiting delivery\u201d for a long time after the  actual delivery date. Therefore, my payment had not been released.I called the UK customer services number but ended up speaking to a totally disinterested customer  rep in Miami. She informed me that UK Royal Mail tracking does not automatically update on their website.   Hence, they won\u2019t release payment unless the buyer makes contact with them. He had remained unresponsive, so there was no progress. Although I requested  on the phone that the watch be updated to delivered status by her clicking on the courier link, she refused.  She just constantly stated they needed an email response from the buyer as proof of delivery & would not accept the Royal Mail tracking confirmation as proof of delivery. So there you have it, as a Seller you are at the total mercy of the buyer.  C24 will not accept the Courier tracking as proof of delivery. C24 are very keen on promotion & glitzy advertising, but do not seem to have invested the same amount of money in their employee training.In addition I also had to fill in a money laundering form twice before it was finally accepted  on behalf of Mango Pay their payment provider to verify my identity.Despite my watch being the lowest price example on C24, it still took over 2 months to sell. I know from previous experience it would only have taken 1 week on ebay.  So with hindsight it would have been easier to sell on ebay, despite their seemingly higher commission. However, Sellers be aware if you are selling to an overseas buyer.  C24 also manage to take some extra commission in addition to their declared transaction fee. This is derived from the terrible currency conversions they use when converting from the buyers native currency to your currency when the buyer make an offer. Although, the converted rate is shown before sales completion, you have no choice but to accept their conversion rate if you want the sale to go ahead.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Very shady company", "text": "Very shady company.

Fact: The watch was incorrectly advertised - After I had decided to purchase the watch I was made aware that the add had incorrect information. Non-trivial information like what material the watch was made of(!)- I was disappointed but decided to keep my interest Fact: The watch arrived in a much worse condition than anticipated - The watch didn\u2019t actually work. I took it to my local watch expert who inserted a new battery - The expert also made me aware of the other problems with the watch: The strap was extremely weak (it broke the day after and fell off my wrist), the alarm hand couldn\u2019t be adjusted consistently, the compass didn\u2019t actually work, some of the smaller dials (e.g., 24h) didn\u2019t work consistently- His conclusion was that it needed inside cleaning Fact: I wanted to use my 14 days return right but I was \u201cguaranteed satisfaction\u201d if I would only send back the watch for repair - I was sent many guarantees: \u201cDon\u2019t worry.

After so many tries to get a hold of her or someone, the New York office told me that they need a letter of power of attorney and the 2 IDs for pick up. So I did that and called the New York office and they confirmed everything is good now. The next day again same lady from Germany stopped the pick up because the 2 IDs were not on the same page, so I edit them and put both IDs on the same page. Then I hear back again that she wants the 2 IDs at the same place and the photo shouldn\u2019t be edited (at this point I\u2019m losing my mind, how can the 2 IDs be in the same place, if I was there next to him then I would\u2019ve just came and picked it up, this made no sense). Lastly I asked New York office if I can cancel the order and place a new one under my friends name so he can pick it up they said yes, then called me 30 minuets later and told me if we cancel the order then it takes 24 hours for the watch to become available for purchase again and by that time my friend would have been flying back to Canada.

This was a gift for my groom and 1st Rolex purchase. Had several time-consuming issues with customs, currency exchange rates, and form submissions that delayed the delivery of the watch, that finally arrived the week of my wedding. I contacted the Rolex Service Center, and was informed they do not offer authentication services. While picking up our wedding bands, I asked Jewler's opinion of the watch. He had a watch we thought to be the exact model, on hand. Immediately, he expressed doubt, and with my unexperienced eye, I easily recognized the difference in these characteristics (weight, size of case, Warranty Card Font). Located in a building with many other Jewlers, he asked others to come over to take a look. Each questioned the same features.  With less than 4 days until my wedding I learn this relatively pricey gift intended for my groom, may or may not be genuine.  Immediately, I contacted C24 and as instructed, got the Seller's permission to have the watch opened. Abiding by the protection policy detailed on the website, I circled back to C24 for written permission to open the watch. Over the event filled week of my wedding, the seller sent several lengthy messages, pressing me to have the watch opened. I indicated each time that I needed C24 to provide the written permission so I could retain my protection as the buyer.  As our out- of-town guest arrived and planned events started,  I found myself being hounded and needing to respond to more than 25 emails. Time intended for final touches and preparation for my wedding, which I spent nearly 2 years planning,  was wasted on this fiasco. Those precious days were consumed with research, phone calls, opinion comparison, protection confirmation, reviewing and responding to an absorbent number of emails, locating back-up gifts, securing additional funds for alternative watches, and worst of all, worrying about this watch.   Never once did Seller or C24 offer any assistance or verifiable reassurance towards the authentication. Finally, 2 days after the wedding, C24 provided written permission, instructing me to take the watch to Rolex. Again, as they had just one week prior, Rolex stated they do not authenticate watches. After explaining the the nightmare transaction, Rolex opened the watch, and explained that two models of this particular Datejust were produced in 2016.

In Jan 2022 I purchased a 2005 Rolex Explorer II 16570 Polar dial from Scandinavian Luxury AB t/a The Vintage Watch Agency (the Seller). In short, I had to hire a Lawyer in Stockholm to demand restitution for misrepresenting and selling a fake watch. It's a long story that cost me almost two thousand dollars, but for those of you interested - please read on.After a few days I noticed the watch was not keeping good time and the seller had apparently listed the wrong 3186 calibre instead of the older 3185 Calibre. The seller agreed for me to return the watch, but It had to be returned from within Europe to avoid customs duties. I was already in the States. Time passed beyond the date I had hoped to return to Europe so in September 2022 I decided to accept the watch with the older Calibre and have it serviced by Rolex RSC in Dallas. In Nov 2022 Rolex informed me the Watch was not eligible for Service. They said the Serial Number was Altered. (photo below)I informed Chrono24 and the Dealer.  The Dealer, after Speaking to RSC Dallas and at C24's suggestion, instructed me to return the watch so that it could be sent to Rolex HQ in Geneva, Switzerland. \"Txxo\" at Chrono24 told me that Rolex Europe operated differently than Rolex USA. ( Hard to believe, but whatever..) I travelled back to Europe and returned the Watch to the seller in Dec 2022. Time passed and I had no news. In Feb 2023 The seller informed me that the Local AD Bergstr\u00f6ms was willing to service the Watch. I refused, Local AD's are independently operated and do not always adhere to the same standards and procedures of Official RSC's. Evidently the AD \"Bergstr\u00f6ms\" failed to notice the Altered serial number or was willing to overlook it. I insisted that Rolex carry out the service as agreed (which I was going to pay for). Eventually the seller claimed to have sent it to RSC Geneva, and told me it could take 3 months. June 2023, Still no news, I asked the seller to provide proof or a receipt that they sent the watch to Rolex or refund me. They refused, and told me to wait longer. I called Rolex to see if they had my watch, but they could not confirm this. I sent a demand Letter to the Vintage Watch Agency for a refund, which they ignored. I reached out to Chrono24, and they replied stating it's not their problem and that they were no longer mediating this issue. I initiated an ECC and ODR out of court claim, that the seller also Ignored. So in Sept 2023 I had to hire a lawyer in Stockholm, who looked at my claim and agreed to bring a lawsuit against the seller. The seller responded saying they would refund me the cost of the watch, less $1,000 dollars for \"servicing and handling\". Emotion and rational thinking are incompatible, as was the cost to pay my Lawyer to argue the settlement. I reluctantly accepted their disgusting offer and cut my losses. Once I  got my money I was asked to leave feedback on the Chrono24 site. Well, I tried to leave a five sentence summary of my wonderful experience, but C24 rejected my reviews twice. They Told me that the Seller has to approve my review in this case.In conclusion, don't buy from Chrono24.They claim that every watch sold is Guaranteed Authentic.

Having spent months looking for a watch I finally went ahead to buy one. The first problem was having agreed to buy the watch Chrono send you their escrow account details to pay into.Only they give you the wrong account name. They tell you to pay it to an account under the name 'Chrono24 GmbH'. The bank immediately flagged this up as potential fraud given the account is actually listed under a third party company called 'mangopay' who Chrono24 use for their escrow account.So I had my transaction blocked by the bank (and almost my account) as the name and account details Chrono gave me did not match. It took 3 calls to Chrono24 to figure out what was happening when finally the customer service agent admitted it and said 'it happens all the time, you need to send it through under the name 'mangopay' not chrono.I thought this was the end of my issues...wrong! Next Chrono24 ask me to send extra verification. Which now required me to upload personal documents and a video of myself to a third party company called IDNOW. A company which have a trustpilot rating of 2.8. When I called up to query this, because you know, identity theft and cybersecurity are a thing...Chrono customer services were hopless.One agent said I would be contacted back, didn't happen. The next said she would email me details. Didn't happen. The final one actually became very aggressive on the phone because I had the audacity to care about cybersecurity and then ask for information about when I would be seeing my own money again. Spoken over. Spoken down too. All I asked was to verify directly with Chrono and not some dodgy third party with 2.8 on trustpilot.As it stands, Chrono have taken 16k from me and put it in one of their third party accounts. Almost got me blocked out of my own bank account through their obfuscation and wasted countless hours. Then sent me around their customer 'service' hellscape in which nobody is on the same page nor does anything they tell you they will do. Then you get the belittling Marcel who loses his temper because you're not wanting to send your passport and a video of yourself to a dodgy third party outfit online. So right now, I am completely stuck and awaiting the mythical email they keep promising you.What a joke.

Just a person on a phone to tick the box...but you're alone here. Will I ever see my money again? I am sure they'll respond below...'we will forward this to our customer service'. Which is basically the shredder so far as I can tell. This is all wrong. How can they get away with this when there is so much money involved?! Next port of call unfortunately looks like it will be me putting in a fraud case with my own bank against the payment to try and it back. A nightmare.UPDATE: Within 1 hour of this review being published Chrono24 cancelled my account due to 'security reasons'. This is the kind of company we are dealing with here.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "More prompt responses to issues.", "text": "More prompt responses to issues.It's like I will do it when I get to it kind of working style.

As a customer that relied on your assurances of a safe transaction, authentic watches, and reliable dealers, I am deeply dissatisfied with the outcome, which failed to meet these commitments.I recently purchased a vintage Breitling watch from Pasini Gioielli, which was explicitly advertised as being in perfect condition and featuring an automatic mechanism. However, upon receiving the watch, I quickly noticed several issues directly contradicting the seller's claims. Firstly, the watch was a mechanical timepiece instead of the advertised automatic one. The watch didn\u2019t work and needed service. Additionally, the small hands had been replaced with non-original Breitling hands.I contacted Chronos 24 to report the problems and suggested a possible solution. I proposed that I would be willing to keep the watch if the seller agreed to refund the servicing costs and cover the expenses associated with restoring the original hands.Regrettably, neither Chronos 24 nor Pasini Gioielli accepted any responsibility for the situation, nor did they demonstrate any willingness to rectify the matter.  In fact, the only resolution offered to me was to return the watch at my own expense. This proposal is deeply troubling, due to the return policies outlined, which state that the seller may withhold the refund if they deem the watch to be in anything other than its original condition. Considering the unreliability and lack of transparency displayed by the seller thus far, assuming such a risk is simply untenable.  Ultimately, I didn\u2019t return it and accepted $65 that the Chronos 24 paid for the small hands.In summary, it is clear that Chronos 24 has failed to provide the support and assistance expected from a trusted platform. Furthermore, Pasini Gioielli's conduct has been highly unprofessional and unreliability as a dealer.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Many fake listings and the site\u2026", "text": "Many fake listings and the site supports them.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "The seller never gave me the paperwork.", "text": "Date of experience: November 15, 2023", "rating": 1}, {"title": "The seller did not fulfill his promise\u2026", "text": "The seller did not fulfill his promise sending me the additional accessories.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "I couldn't get an answer regarding\u2026", "text": "I couldn't get an answer regarding tariff.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "My small and simple question still not\u2026", "text": "My small and simple question still not solved", "rating": 1}, {"title": "The promised wrist extension has never\u2026", "text": "The promised wrist extension has never arrived, constant excuses.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Poor", "text": "Poor, can\u2019t cancel ", "rating": 1}, {"title": "annoying app", "text": "Don\u2019t want to race a review", "rating": 1}, {"title": "i did not sold the watch,don't send any\u2026", "text": "i did not sold the watch,don't send any email to me", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Got scammed and could not get my money\u2026", "text": "Got scammed and could not get my money back!", "rating": 1}, {"title": "I was told that I could return the watch if I was not happy with it before 14 days.

However he still requested a \"certificate of authenticity\" which is something I can't provide. you may also please audit the email he sent to me it was so unprofessional. if the goal is to proof the watch authenticity the service quote from the manufacturer would suffice to proof this as per the watch manufacturer. However, communicating with alen doesn't lead to anywhere. alen failed to listen and exercise logic in his response.     Furthermore, I requested for my inquiry to be escalated to the manager but he wouldn't listen. alen mentioned that he is the most capable individual in the chrono24 and in charge.Would you be able to assist me with my issue as a mediator and review my case or escalate this matter with a manager at chrono24.

After 2 weeks, it was clear there was an issue with the transfer and again requested Chrono24 to advise for a solution. They replied advising for my patience until the transfer is refunded back to them before they can initiate once again.My bank was able to trace the payment using the swift copy and they found out the payment has been rejected by the intermediary banks due to C24\u2019s payment service provider not providing a purpose for the payment transfer.After 64 days, they confirmed the transfer has been refunded and they are preparing to initiate a second transfer attempt, I asked for an alternative payment however they refused, and initiated the transfer a week later.A week after the second transfer attempt, and upon not receiving the payout amount to my account, I contacted them to enquire why i have not received the amount and requested them intervene. long story short, the transfer failed - as per the bank the reason is not providing cover funds within the time frame.Upon not receiving any feed back or any satisfactory customer service, I decided to email the senior management at both Chrono24 & MangoPay (Their payment service provider). With the hope and expectation that they would clean this mess and offer a resolution. Besides apologizing for the inconvenience, they offered zero support and the circus show went on.After 100 days of waiting for my payout, i called their customer service and was able to speak to directly with department head, who promised once the second transfer was refunded back to them and understanding the reason of the transfer failure, C24 will discuss with me an alternative payout solution.The above did not happen as on Day 108, I received an email from Chrono24/Mango Pay that they have located the transfer funds in a bank in the US and have already green lighted the bank to proceed with immediate effect. Obviously leaving me furious.A week after the above and not receiving the funds, I contacted Chrono24 and was informed by them to deal and sort it out with MangoPay.Well folks, today is day 139, and after more than 100 emails and over 30 international phone calls with Chrono24, who i must say are absolutely useless, I am yet to receive my payout from Chrono24.Note that I have successfully sold 5 watches previously on the platform with no change to my bank account details, which is stored with them.So to briefly conclude,As the payment processor is an integral part of C24 business model. C24 have facilitated, managed and taken money (fees) for this transaction therefore they're responsible for fixing any issues along the way. They're currently showing that they don't care about their customers and are unwilling to assist in fixing problems that occur when using their service.

The watch was running 10 hours slow per day. I repeat that. 10 hour slow per day. When I reached out to the seller they ignored me and passed me off to Chrono24 \u201cmediation\u201d team.

This is a big deal on a blancpain watch - as it only has a two year warranty. I effectively lost 1/6 of the warranty value straight out of the box.

If you are a professional watch dealer, you wont imagine how this platform allows a customer to ruin a watch you want to sell, as well as your profile. As a buyer, If you want to scam a seller, buy a watch and use it as you want for 2 weeks and then return it for no reason, chrono24 is just right platform for you. In addition, you can easily steal the watch by claiming that there is no watch in the box, even though you have purchased an expensive watch and received the product. You can also claim your watch hasn't arrived during the pandemic as DHL or other couriers was not provide proof of delivery. This platform just right platform to lose your watch and your money.Unfortunately, an unworn watch we sold on this platform, a malicious customer wanted to return it after 10 days without giving any reason, I could not explain my problem to the UK representative of chrono24, she is very rude and far from what she does, you will be deceived by the customer, lose money, even she doesn't care if your account is destroyed, she is just trying her best to make herself available to higher authorities.As a customer, If you have a special day, if you are going to a wedding, go to chrono24 and get a watch you like, after 10 days return the watch without giving any reason and get all your money back, then complain to chrono24 that the seller complained about you.Being a platform away from the safe selling of watches, chrono24 will allow you to return the watch in very bad condition since it was first sold, leave a bad review, and even allow the customer representative to be rude to the seller.In order not to be a victim anymore, I stopped selling on this platform, I closed my account. Now everything is stress free, trust me you will make better business if you stop selling on chrono24.I am ready to prove my bad experience from the beginning to the end, I recommend ebay to professional sellers, they provide both authenticity check and you get your money without any problems.

The watch was described as 100% authentic, hardly used and I got it at a standard price. Nothing to worry about I thought. The seller was Chrono-Arena from Germany \u2013 and of course approved by Chrono24.Fast forward to now. I go to a Rolex / Tudor AD to get it serviced because the dial fell got loose. However, the AD repair shop does not want to touch it as it has unoriginal parts. I now have a watch that I can't use, sell or get serviced. I try to contact the seller, Chrono-Arena. No reply. Chrono24 sends them a couple of messages to contact me but that's it. No reply. And no further help from Chrono24. Basically, there is NO Buyer Protection as Chrono24 claim. As a buyer you have no security on Chrono24 \u2013 as it seems scammers can unload their unoriginal watches on Chrono24 with Chrono24 vouching for them.Eg. Chrono24.com states: 'In the rare instance that the watch is counterfeit, you will receive your money back.'... don't believe them. You're on your own. They will NOT reimburse you.If you're in the market for a Rolex, AP, Tudor, Omega, Panerai etc. Chrono24.com is the last platform you should use.

They told me it was defective from the start and that no seller should have been offering me a product with those QC issues.My watch wont be available for at least one month and Seiko can't really tell the amount of damage done on the movement due to this malfunction ...

When you finally email support they tell you about the flaw and ask that you enter a Shipping Address that matches the Billing Address, and then send an email afterwards correcting the Shipping address as a workaround.This workaround is silly, but the fact that dozens of customers have to waste time trying the cart because there is no notice about the limitation is unacceptable.

Courier did not arrive i was travelling and then they said it is too late!", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Chrono24: Buyer Beware!", "text": "UPDATE 5: A more complete picture below, but Buyer Beware states the point. I bought a Frankenwatch and can't return it. Simply: Chrono24's system and policies protect fraudulent sellers. A buyer has a short window in which to review a seller. I bought from a highly rated seller, Ralf Pieper Internethandel, using Trusted Checkout. The seller took a very long time to send the watch and move through what became an arduous process. I did not know the full extent to how I had been cheated until after Chrono24's review window had closed, so other Chrono24 buyers cannot be notified that Ralf Pieper Internethandel lied about selling me an Omega with original parts, and that the watch has a condensation problem that they promised to fixed, but failed to correct. I suspect it's not possible to fix as the case and dial size do not match exactly in this \"frankenwatch.\" ORIGINAL REVIEW:If you buy from Chrono24, (which is a dicey proposition considering the review system is rigged for the sellers), only use Trusted Checkout. I suggest you immediately take your purchase to a reputable vintage watch expert to see if you've been cheated like I was. Only then will Chrono24 take any responsibility for fixing the situation. In my situation, I'm sitting with a Frankenwatch that build up condensation on the inside of the crystal.I purchased a watch through Chrono24 using a Trusted Checkout. But the process after that has been beyond frustrating. The short version is that I bought from a well-reviewed seller in Germany, (I'm in the US), who then slow-rolled my entire post-purchase process. He sent me a faulty $1500 Omega watch. (The watch gets condensation buildup inside the crystal.) Then slow-rolled a warrantied repair. He requested I use FedEx to ship back to him and promised to pay my repair related shipping costs. He took ages to pick up the watch from German customs, then took ages to do the repair. By the time I got the Omega back, months had passed from the original purchase, and on top of this, the problem was not fully resolved. I have been patient and polite, yet the seller has stopped responding to my messages and clearly knows I have no recourse beyond his own conscience. So long has passed since my purchase that I can not review the seller as Chrono24 has a short window in which to review, which I couldn't do properly until I had a working watch.I went from being excited about Chrono24 to feeling like it's a huge waste of time and money. I strongly recommend against anyone I know using Chrono24 as it's far too risky to spend significant amounts of money, (my watch which is still not in the promised condition), has now cost me nearly $2000.00 US). This is a massive  level of fraud on the part of the seller and incompetence on the part of Chrono24. Don't take the risk!UPDATE 1: Per the seller's notification of a personal issue after posting this review, I will update this review when the issue is resolved. As it stands, I've been promised reimbursement for over two months and yet to receive. I am certainly sympathetic to the personal issue, however a PayPal payment takes minutes to complete. As for Chrono24's assertion that my contractual partner is with the dealer or private seller, I have no way to review the seller on Chrono24 as Chrono24 only allows a buyer to review for 14 days after purchase. My purchase was made on June 6th and my issues still have not resolved. More generally, this means that prospective buyers reading reviews only know about issues with sellers that crop up very quickly, protecting sellers rather than buyers by limiting the information available to determine whether a seller is reliable.UPDATE 2: Per Chrono24 request to confirm if I have received reimbursement via PayPal, I have not.UPDATE 3: I was unable to respond immediately due to work. I have since responded, and resent my PayPal address, which I had given the seller multiple times before. As I have continued to have problems with condensation forming inside the watch crystal, I took the watch to a reputable vintage watch dealer in Beverly Hills, which is near where I live. After a brief inspection, they informed me while the watch was sold to me as \"all original parts\" it is a Frankenwatch. Makes sense why the deealer/seller didn't want me to take it to a local shop for repair, but instead had me send it all the way back to Germany for them to \"repair.\" Now I have to work on returning it using the 1 year warranty. I hope I can finally be done with this. I hope Chrono24 will continue to be helpful with this, as ultimately this review is of them, and their handling of a company that their site states they trust and the polices in place to protect buyers from fraudulent sales such as this one.UPDATE 5: I finally received reimbursement for shipping costs of the repair. Unfortunately, as stated above, the watch was not actually repaired. As it stands I have been trying to get the dealer to take a return under the one year warranty. They said they would \"repair\" the watch again if I pay the shipping, but as they sent a faulty watch and lied about it's authenticity, and have already failed once to repair it, once I can't trust that a second \"repair\" will yield positive results. I have followed up with them requesting to return, and they have not responded to my messages. Chrono24 says they can't/won't do anything to force the dealer to make good on their 1 year warranty and did not respond to my last message.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "The vintage Lemania advertised as in\u2026", "text": "The vintage Lemania advertised as in excellent working order, does NOT work!!!I've been taken by Leo!!Do Not do biz here!", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Bad as u imagine!", "text": "Date of experience: September 30, 2019", "rating": 1}, {"title": "no help when it was necessary.", "text": "Date of experience: September 23, 2019", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Was charged fedex fees that were not\u2026", "text": "Was charged fedex fees that were not disclosed", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Not a good place to spend your hard\u2026", "text": "Not a good place to spend your hard earned money - The private sellers I have experienced have all been dishonest in their description - describing clearly damaged watches as 'like new' etc , avoid like the plague.In light of Chrono24's reply:I can assure you 100% I have made several purchase via chrono24The request asked for an (OPTIONAL) purchase reference number , as it's OPTIONAL I don't have to provide one.There's NOTHING inappropriate about the language used above  as you suggest,.... it's merely an honest but negative review of my experience with your website...I\u2019ve been asked to also add a review of the customer service I experience:  this was sporadic (sometimes a day or so would pass before a reply) and sometimes complete silence (completely ignoring emails) at times , so in summary the customer service I experienced was less than helpful and bordering on of no help at all.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Buyer Beware!", "text": "Had a terrible experience with this site.

Six sellers included exactly -- and I mean \"exactly\" -- the same photograph: sellers in Italy, Germany, UK, USA, Monaco and Hong Kong. Another two sellers (in UK and USA) showed the same photo of a different watch. Clearly, C24 could care less.I then Googled \"fake Lange & Sohne 1815 Annual Calendar\". This produced scores of hits -- which described the watches as \"replicas\".Many of those hits displayed exactly the same photos that appeared on C24. My advice would be to request the seller to give you the serial number and to send 2 photos of the actual watch offered, set to times of your choice (as C24 does with private sellers). At least that way you start with some \"solid\" information. If the seller is not interested in making the sale you will hear nothing more.

Until I confirmed I was happy with the watch the seller didn\u2019t get the money.  You have 14 days protection with Chrono24 after that period you are on your own with the warranty being between you and the seller.  If your watch arrives working and in the condition, you expect then this 14 day protection is pretty much useless as you will accept the watch and pay for it.  It doesn\u2019t consider issues that might arise over time.The specific seller (A&K Watches Gmbh & Co \u2013 Germany) \u2013 the watch arrived well packaged and on time.  However, even though I was assured the watch was perfect condition there were signs of wear on the bezel and a light scratch on the glass once closely inspected.  These were visible in the pictures online, I didn\u2019t zoom in enough, so accepted them. But a no point during the pre-sales process were these brought to my attention even though I specially asked if there was any damage, no matter how small and for extra pictures.  The watch was stated as being \u2018serviced\u2019 in July (a month before I brought it) which made me assume it was serviced via Omega.  It was an 11-year-old watch and when I enquired with Omega the watch had never actually been serviced by them.For the first 2 months the watch was fine but then it started to develop issues with the Chronograph and when adjusting the time.  This was reported to the seller straight away and I said I would monitor the issues to see if it was a one off or going to get worse.  Over the next month the issues got worse to the point I wanted to return the watch under the 12 month guarantee I received from the seller (note this is not with Chrono24). The seller arranged return postage (after some toing and froing) and it was returned at a cost to them.Once received the seller straight away accused me of either using it incorrectly or dropping it causing the damage.   There was no physical damage to it (it was in exactly the same condition as when I received it) and considering the watch, as reported to them, had slowly deteriorate in functionality and reliability over time how could a specific drop or action I did caused this damage.  I have a number of other luxury watches and am experienced on how to use them so I assured them I had not done anything incorrectly with is.  It also asked what was wrong, how it could have happened and if it could be repaired with none of the questions ever being answered.  They would not fix the watch (even though it obviously had an issue before they sold it and they had just bodged a repair that has now gone wrong) and also informed me I had to pay for return shipping which wasn\u2019t made clear when I returned it.Throughout the process (they had my watch for over 6 weeks) the communication was terrible, all I wanted was my questions answered and them to fixed the watch.  To me this is just good customer service.None of the questions were ever answered and in the end the seller threatened me with legal action if I didn\u2019t stop asking.  Luckily, I have the watch back now and will be sending it to Omega.  The basic service will cost \u00a3550 and I am hoping what ever is wrong with the watch will be covered by this.  If not, it will be more expense on top of this.Support from Chrono24 \u2013 this is non-existent post the 14-day period after purchase.  Once past this period the support service merely passes messages between you and the seller.  The warranty is between you and the seller but this can\u2019t be enforced.

Without even asking for any information they automatically assumes it is an \"bank charge issue\" and throw the problem back to us, assuming everyone else is stupid and couldn't figure that out. Even worse is that when I sent them the email, I had additional information showing that I transferred 20,000 USD but they only received 15,000 from my account on their website. No bank, no matter how many intermediaries in between will charge 5000 USD for any transaction yet they came back several times with the same ignorant and pretentious response (just like above) of \"...these are bank charges fees. We kindly ask you to submit the missing amount.\" Despite the fact that this is an obvious clerical error and I was urging them to check their accounting and their bank, their adamant inflexibility continually to respond with a \"...these are bank charges fees. We kindly ask you to submit the missing amount. \" implying it is my problem, not theirs and i should check my bank and they will do basically nothing.So I called my bank again.... waiting on the average 1h for 3 department transfers to get to the right department (yes, everytime I had to wait about that long and by now it is the 2nd time I called the bank... will need to call again later... stay tuned). They said they transferred the complete amount and because my bank and their bank are partnered banks, there are no intermediary banks and the maximum fees between the 2 banks is <200$ . I wrote back to Chrono24 to tell this and I received the the same old middle finger response- your problem you solve it, they won't do anything.SO I CALLED MY BANK AGAIN (AND YES, ANOTHER HOUR WASTED). The bank told me that the only thing I can do is put a tracer on the transfer so I had to put MY OWN 300$ to trace a money that I, or my bank, did nothing wrong. Low and behold, the result was a clerical error from ING bank, what a surprise!The answers I keep on getting from Chrono are like mechanized bots-\"Your banks problem... check the fees...make the transfer...\". If Chrono is not using bots it will save so much money by firing the whole after-sales department and installing bots and this will not decrease the quality of its service- guaranteed.

Chrono24 will leave you out in the cold alone, and has NO FOLLOWUP whatsoever. The representative was completely unconcerned, and informed me that as a third party merchant Chrono24 was not in the watch business at all, and could not be bothered in the least. They refused to give me the name, phone number or email of a supervisor who could take responsibility to respond. Their emails asking me to confirm delivery on a watch still in London to this day are still sent to me every day.

It did not sell.I have since requested a refund for my ad listing and received instructions on how to do so. I followed this instructions immediately and responded with everything that was asked. Heard nothing further since. When you advertise on this site beware. Every now and then they will say that they will delete your ad, during this 6 month period. If you agree to this remember that your watch will then not have been advertised continually for 6 months, as required to receiver a full refund. It is clear that as time goes on they look for ways to avoid paying a listing refund by trying to remove adverts so they can claim that they did not run continually. Also the requirement is totally on the seller to contact them at the end of 6 months BUT WITHIN A MONTH OF THE 6 MONTHS ENDING in order to be eligible for the refund. Any more hoops to jump through perhaps?Then once the 6 months is up, the once quick service reply of within 24 hours is no longer valid when you want your money back.The final point is that they have marked the watch on their site as SOLD which it most certainly is not! This is misleading to potential customers falsely indicating watches as sold when they have not been. Here is the link to the advert for my watch which is still in my possession unsold.You can look for yourself on the site by looking for the watch ID: 7746034Do not use this company to sell your watch. For luxury items like this do the right thing and go through a reputable dealer. They did not help sell my watch and did everything they could to hold onto the listing fee.EDIT: In response to Chrono 24's reply. I was constantly asked if my ad should be deleted and when I asked why I was given this reason. When I asked about a refund, knowing about the 6 month policy and being happy with that, the alarm bells came when the word \"continuously\" was used. i.e. the advert had to remain up continuously for 6 months. Yet I was being constantly asked if I wanted my ad to be deleted. Would I have received a refund if I had agreed? What benefit was there to me agreeing that if my watch was unsold? The only reason for the offer is to be able to say after 6 months the ad hadn't been up for 6 months \"continuously\". Also, the advert may now be marked as \"unavailable\" but it was marked as sold for 2 full days at least, for which I have kept proof. So had I not brought this up would this status have been changed or would prospective Chrono 24 users think that the sale had been concluded successfully by Chrono 24 when it hadn't at all? This doesn't seem like honest behaviour.Speaking of which, finally, is it any coincidence that following a negative review on Trust Pilot a raft of 5 star, very short, often badly spelled reviews suddenly appear offering no description of the user experience? Some are just saying \"the website is great\" which seems an odd thing to post, especially considering these are posted by people with zero previous reviews. Yet they are suddenly compelled to leave their 3 word review for the amazing Chrono 24 experience they've had? Based on the fact that Chrono 24 are quite happy to mislead prospective users as to the sold status of an item, it isn't really a reach to think they'd use false reviewing on here. Suffice to say I have reported the suspicious behaviour.Any readers on Trust Pilot, I urge you to sift through the reviews fully and decide which you think are genuine user experiences and which are not. It's pretty clear that Bob saying something likes \"Chrono 24 what's is great\" as a review seems a bit fishy compared to someone's actually experience.And yes I have my refund but I'd put money on that being a result of the review on here.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Bought what was listed as an original\u2026", "text": "Bought what was listed as an original Rolex tritium insert for submariner.

I got only good feedbacks from this marketplace and his good reputation.So, I made a proposal to the seller which is Collectors Coins & Jewelry of Baldwin in NY State, USA. Their website is Collectors1946.com.I proposed an amount below the price published on Chrono24 and they explained to me that can provide me a better price/negotiations if I order through their own website. They also told me they have an agreement with Chrono24.com to sell off the website. I felt confident and in trust and I ordered the watch. It was in March 2018.Some weeks later, I decided to send it to a watchmaker to clean the case and watch, and perform a very light polishing. When we opened the case, what we saw was a disaster: The caliber was the one of the 5513 (1570 instead of 1520). I felt really abused and ashamed. My trust has been hurted and I paid a watch 2 or 3 times his real value.The caliber 1520 was clearly mentioned in Chrono24. com.Now, I'm discussing with the seller and I have contacted Chrono24.com to find a solution.So, avoid this marketplace and I advise you to go to brick and mortar shops if you want to buy a Rolex. There are so many cheaters who are profiting from the attraction of this fantastic brand.I will update my post accordingly to the solution COLLECTORS1946.COM or CHRONO24.com will propose to me.To the answer from chrono24 below:The ordering process has started on your website as they use the internal mailbox to propose to sell off your platform.

Big mistake.  Their sellers are supposed to be properly vetted and trustworthy.  Didn't seem so.  Thinking the website offered buyer protection as they claimed, I bought from one of their 'trusted sellers' in Sicily, Italy.  The watch was sold as unworn / perfect.  It arrived scratched, with a very worn strap i.e. apparently pre-owned and used.I contacted Chrono24, and they said send the package / watch it back to the seller.  I did so, using the exact same box and packaging as the seller had sent it in.  The seller then claimed the box had arrived  irreparably damaged, so couldn't be refunded.  The seller refused to accept the delivery, and when I demanded proof of this alleged damage, the seller then sent a video showing the seller vigorously shaking the box like a ragdoll.  Obviously, when you shake a box with something inside, it makes a sound.  If you shake it hard enough, it makes more sound.  And, if you shake a box containing something valuable, would you likely damage that valuable item?  So, I asked Chrono24 to intervene as the seller had obviously sold an item that seemed pre-worn as new, and was now trying to avoid refunding the money by claiming the item had arrived back irreparably damaged, whilst greatly increasing the likelihood that the item Was damaged, by shaking it like a ragdoll in its box.  This seemed wrong on many levels.Did Chrono24 help?  No, they refused to comment on the video, or ask for proof of the alleged damage.  So I was on my own.Worse still, as the seller refused delivery, the item then went back into the Italian postal service, to be resent to the UK - with no extra / return postage paid.  This means that it goes by the slowest route possible, with none of the protection that items sent by courier / special delivery have - it could have been lost, or indeed damaged, in transit.  I then had to ring the national collection service in the UK every day for over a month to try and track the item down when it arrived back to the UK.  I had to hassle them with emails asking for help and their default response [when they Did respond, belatedly and cursorily] was - Not our problem, deal with it yourself.  If that's the case, what exactly do they do that's different to ebay?  Is there any point using them if they take your money and offer no guarantee of practical protection?  Chrono24 offered no help, no comfort, no counsel.  Is that fair?So, after over a month the item arrived back to the national collection centre, and I was able to get it sent back to me.  The box was of course undamaged.  Not a scratch.  The watch however was scratched - as its box had been shaken like a ragdoll by the seller.  So I had to pay lots of money to have it polished, and then lots more to have it sent back to the seller.  It was so carefully-packaged with bubble wrap / tissue paper when I sent it back the second time that it simply couldn't be damaged by shaking it.  Eventually I got the money back, with no explanation or apology from the seller or Chrono24 - however, the refund was MINUS over \u00a3100 for the cost of sending the box back to the seller twice, and having an item which was delivered to me scratched, polished.  Did Chrono24 apologize?  Of course they didn't.  Does that sound fair?  Did Chrono24 help sufficiently?  Should you trust Chrono24 to ensure that their sellers are genuine, and to help you if a bad seller tries to screw you over of a lot of money?  That's for you to decide, but I almost lost a Lot of money, and still lost a great Deal of money, through no fault of my own.  I had a terrible experience and cannot possibly recommend this company at all.ADDENDUM, IN REPLY TO CHRONO24 AND THEIR EMAIL BELOW [8/6/17]This is a curious response from Chrono24 - Ignoring the substance of the review and the multiple areas of concern, to focus on one technicality about postal procedure which wasn't in question.  This is known as diversion.The crux is deeply imperfect screening of vendors, lack of transparency, incomplete / tardy / piecemeal communication, lack of buyer protection from dubious vendor activity, and to finish it off, total want of courtesy, let alone true effort to compensate financial loss as a result of dubious vendor activity.Diversion does not work.

It's a phony stamp of approval given at Chrono24's discretion even if the dealer has done nothing to deserve it, other than just being a registered member. In fact, even if the dealer has been negligent or done something wrong towards the customer, Chrono24 deliberately lets the dealer keep the 'Trusted Seller' designation to ensure that the dealer continues to be a client of theirs. So if it says that a dealer is a 'Trusted Seller since 2010' there is no guarantee at all that this dealer has been a good/trusted dealer for years - despite what the designation indicates. In other words, Chrono24 is on the seller's side - so buyers beware! This should be illegal, but instead of suing them, I am warning other potential buyers here. \r Here's what I experienced: \rI purchased a Rolex watch from an Italian dealer listed on Chrono24. As usual I did my due diligence e.g. checked if there was a physical shop, that there was no negative feedback on the internet, checked the pictures in the ad and had the seller confirm via email and phone that the watch was indeed in mint condition.\r So imagine my surprise when the watch I received came with a chipped crystal where chunks of the crystal edge had come off. In addition the markers and hands on the dial were heavily oxidated most likely from exposure to moisture. The lume had swollen and become slightly cracked, again indicating moisture/water. This was not a vintage watch, so this not a case of patina but rather improper use. I am a very experienced watch collector and this watch was in below average condition at best. Maybe 4/10 or 5/10 on a 10/10 scale. Certainly light years away from being mint condition and 9/10.\r I immediately contacted the dealer and attached pictures illustrating all the issues. To my surprise and frustration the seller denied that he had done anything wrong at all and in fact accused me of having done this to the watch myself. Apart from the watch being in much poorer condition than shown in the ad - upon further investigation of the watch, it turned out that the watch was indeed not the exact watch shown in the ad. The dial of the watch I had received had a different variation of fonts printed and the box and the accessories it came in was different as well. \r I told the seller that I would like to return the watch for a full refund. He denied being responsible and said the watch did not look like that when shipping it off to me. So essentially according to him I had replaced the dial, the hands and the crystal with worn parts within minutes of receiving it.\r Seller was not at any point accommodating or willing to discuss. From the get go he said he had done nothing wrong and there was no possibility of any refund or support from his end. The dealer is called La Morella Gioielleria 1973 S.R.L. I strongly recommend staying away from this shop despite looking like a reputable shop.\r During the dispute I contacted Chrono24 (their German head office) and asked them to intervene as I was getting nowhere with seller. After having sent Chrono24 all emails, pictures and other proof, I heard nothing from them despite reminding them several times. After about a month having reminded Chrono24 for the fourth time I received a short mail that they had contacted the seller but there was nothing further they could do (read: would do). \r So a strong word of advice, if buying from a seller listed on Chrono24 be very careful.If scammed by a dishonest dealer you are not in any shape or form protected. Better yet, stay away from Chrono24 all together.\r The dealer in question (like most other sellers listed on Chrono24) has been given the credentials 'Trusted Seller' which according to Chrono24's policy means that Chrono24 has \"no knowledge about pending/unsolved disputes or complaints about the seller\". This is incorrect as I have complained about the seller and there is indeed still an unsolved dispute. The seller still retains these credentials after Chrono24 had been made aware of the dispute and complaint. So Chrono24 is not being truthful towards other potential buyers who may fall into the trap of buying from this dealer in the future. In fact they are being deceitful.\r Consider yourself forewarned!", "rating": 1}]

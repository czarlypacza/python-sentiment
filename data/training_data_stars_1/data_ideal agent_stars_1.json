She sounded motivated when I met her then it went down hill. In six months my house was shown once by another agent not her. I lowered my house by $20,000 and still she wanted me to lower it more to give it away so she could get an easy sell and no work. I told her I was open to offers and bids no counter offers or any showings. This was a waisted 6 months. I contacted ideal agent a few times no help. I wasn\u2019t even called by my realtor to tell me my listing was going to be over. I found out from realtors calling me to ask if I wanted to realist my house because your house is off Market.

Everything started out great and was that way for over 2 years.  I've been licensed for over 10 years and have over 130 5 star reviews with my clients so I've been doing real estate for a long time and have a great track record.  Now the fun starts, IdealAgent got greedy and changed their referral fee from a tiered system based on home selling price with a referral fee paid from agent to IdealAgent between 25%-35% to a flat 35%.  No problems so far until the contract for the referral fee was received and written to go into effect even for the properties that were already under contract and in escrow!  Of course there's nothing an agent can do at that point because their clients home is already in escrow.  This is a VERY shady way of doing things.  While the agents they hire offer great service to clients and it appears that IdealAgent is part of the process they aren't.  They're sitting in the background just collecting referral fees from agents.Based on the reply below it clearly shows you don't want to fix things and retain good agents, your my way or the highway attitude will eventually catch up. Additionally, it appears you're either missing the point completely or trying to sidestep the issue.  The problem is simple, you put a revised referral contract in place months before it went into effect (perfect), however properties that were already referred to an agent prior, now listed on the market and later closed escrow fell under this contract that the agent/broker was trapped into \"conceding\" to.This \"advance notice\" whether for transparency purposes or otherwise created issues...  The statement generated from the IdealAgent referral portal that's to be sent to escrow for payment on the referral also had balance due information from the previous contract eluding to the fact that the new contract was not in force.  Keep in mind this invoice is generated from within the referral portal. So was your GUI system not updated as you updated your contracts?Additionally, as you may or may not know, if a Broker cancels a listing for no real valid reason the broker can be exposed to legal issues and IdealAgent as a neutral referring source, you have no part of the representation so you probably didn't even think that through.  The ethical way to have roled out this increased referral fee would have been to have it go into effect when the contract was signed but only for referrals from that point forward.  This oversight may have been done completely innocently but after repeated attempts to speak with management to fix this issue with no resolve the only conclusion could possibly be that the agents IdealAgent's elected to do business with don't really matter in the grand scheme of things and we're just the pawns for you to facilitate the referral business model.Lastly, including misleading, duplicate information in your contracts only additionally causes confusion.Please do better.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Real estate agent completely mishandled\u2026", "text": "Real estate agent completely mishandled the sale of my home in Cleveland Ohio.

Ideal Agent says that they only provide \"Top Local Agents\".  Renee Wilson was described as a very successful experienced competent agent.  This is NOT the case.  Renee Wilson is the most incompetent, lazy, noncustomer oriented real estate agent I have ever seen.  I think she is down right dangerous.  In fact she specifically told us that she had other clients and that she was busy.  Also, she told us she wasn\u2019t making enough money on the transaction to provide us with service.  The first two things she did were put the property on the MLS for $5000 less than the listing agreement stated.  We got an offer for the \u201csupposed\u201d full price.  Renee then prepared a counteroffer for us to sign electronically but she listed the price as $100,000 less than the actual amount.  Fortunately, we caught this and it was corrected before it was signed.  She provided NO assistance in addressing the inspection issues cited by the Buyer.  We were forced from over 400 miles away to find, schedule and get vendors access to the house.  She drafted a thoroughly inadequate, incorrect response to the Buyer\u2019s repair requests.  When she sent us the response to sign electronically, it had the Seller\u2019s name wrong (the Seller was a trust) and the signature lines had the wrong names.  She tried to persuade us to sign this document.  We refused to sign a legally incorrect document.  We repeatedly asked her in writing if we would have any other fees at closing other than a list of fees we detailed.  She twice told us no in writing.  When we received the closing statement just days before the closing (which clearly Renee had never reviewed though she said in writing she would do so), the real estate commissions were wrong (in her favor) and there was another $2000 in fees that we had specifically asked in writing if we would be responsible for.  She just told us we had to pay those fees.  We got the real estate commissions corrected; she did nothing to correct the other fees.  We paid the fees just to close the transaction and get this horrible experience behind us.  I hope that this is a cautionary tale to others to under no circumstances use Renee Wilson as their real estate agent and not to trust Ideal Agent as a source for referrals of agents.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "this is my genuine experience with 45 years in sales\u2026", "text": "Awesome company", "rating": 1}]

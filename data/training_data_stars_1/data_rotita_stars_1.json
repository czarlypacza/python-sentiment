The quality of the material wasn\u2019t great, but I expected that for the price (the sale price is a fair reflection of value, I\u2019d definitely say full price is absolutely not) and was happy to keep one. However, following return as per the company policy, I received an email stating that no refund would be issued due to stains and smell on the garments, and alleged photos attached to document the concerns. Actually, no photos were attached and the links were empty. Having immediately contacted the company to challenge the decision and ask for sight of the alleged stains, I had a second email response stating that there was \u2018dust\u2019 on the items making them unsaleable and in contravention of the returns policy. Again, no images attached and when I replied querying the difference in alleged faults and the lack of visual proof being provided, I was offered 50% of the costs reimbursed. As this was only about \u00a320 and frankly I had neither the time nor energy to keep emailing and pushing it, I accepted the refund and thought I\u2019d just treat this as a lesson learnt not to shop with Rotita again. However, the money was then credited to my account for use on future purchases, rather than refunded to my payment method. So, I had to write yet more emails, attaching the proof of the previous offer of a reimbursement and pointing out that based on my experience I wouldn\u2019t ever shop with them again so credit was no use at all.

THE QUALITY OF THEIR MERCHANDISE IS POOR AND SIZES DON'T JIVE WITH THE MEASUREMENTS.................................................................................................Where do I start? I placed an order on 7/2/24 for two swimsuits for a scheduled vacation. They never warn you it takes weeks to receive your items and that their business is not located in the USA. My estimated latest shipping date was 7/5 but the items were not shipped out until 7/10.  Eight days for processing a package for shipping is an extensive amount of time. I didn't receive the package until 7/16 which was too late. I had just left on vacation. When I returned, I contacted customer service and requested a refund. I sent the items back unworn in 100% new condition in their original packaging. Their policy is once their warehouse receives your package, they will have 7 days to review the items and issue a refund. I had to contact CS via email because I never received the refund.  I tracked my package and it was delivered on 8/2. I waited the 7 days and nothing.  CS said the warehouse needs more time to review the items and to be patient. Long story short...after numerous emails back and forth with CS, they tell me I received a store credit. I was livid and told them I never authorized a store credit and told them to credit my credit card which was the original form of payment. I finally received a refund, but it was not the same amount as the store credit. They charged me for using the return shipping label which is their policy. My biggest problem with this company is that they charged me $3.72 for shipping insurance (I had a coupon for free shipping) and my bank account was charged a separate international service assessment fee of $2.01. The total purchase price was $67.04. I received a refund of $52.33. I lost a total of $16.72. That is a lot of money to lose when making online clothing purchases.

However because the items seems very good value for money and just what I was looking for, I ordered 3 tops.  They took 3 weeks to arrive and due to the quality and size, I had to return them.  Again I found it very difficult to access their website to arrange a return.  This took several days to finally receive a response and a 'ticket' number, and I emailed them to ask for a returns label.  It was only then that I was informed I had to pay for the return myself.  I asked for a UK address, but they told me no UK address only an address in New Jersey USA.  I was dumbfounded.  Nothing that I was able to access on their website prior to my order informed me that returns had to be sent to America at my own cost.After several more weeks and Rotita originally denying receipt of my parcel, even though the tracking showed they had received it, I finally had a refund.Again, they did not tell me they would deduct money from my refund.  The goods were in the original packing, in perfect condition and unmarked, but they still deducted 6.00 from me.  That together with the 22.00 I had to pay to return the goods to America totalled 28.00 which they still owe me.I have emailed 5 times to ask to speak to their Chief Sales person, or Managing Director, or even a Manager and they just say I have had my refund and totally ignore anything else in my email.To return goods ordered online in the UK usually costs around 4.00 to 6.00 which I would gladly pay, if I knew I had to pay for the return.

I have already provided this to Rotita more than TEN TIMES!! Why do you think I am still screaming for a refund?? I have also repeatedly reminded Rotita that I paid for shipping insurance, so that if anything went wrong with the packages, then I would get a refund or get the product replaced.

MY QUESTION IS WHY IS EVERYTHING SO DIFFICULT AND YOU ARE SO DISHONEST??TOTAL JOKE OF A COMPANY. Ordered items in early Jan. They advertise shipping within 3 - 4 days.

Now have to try to get money refunded by credit card.UPDATE It is now a week past the delivery date given. I have been in contact with this company and asked no less than 4 times for a refund and they refuse. Answers are totally illogical. Told they could not cancel the order because it had shipped and I had to wait for them to be missing before they would refund, how long I have to wait is not clear as far as I am  concerned they have not been delivered now.  Then I am told they have now shipped on 11th Feb so they didn't even leave China until well after the date for delivery and they could have cancelled this order because it hadn't shipped which was their argument in the first place FOR BEING UNABLE TO CANCEL IT. I would NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY . Very slippery business dealings they just want to take your money, VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. SHOCKING DOESNT EVEN COVER IT.FURTHER UPDATE This company has now said that the items have been posted  (ON 11TH) but will take another 3 weeks to get to me, I am to refuse delivery then wait another 3 weeks before they will refund.

They build rudimentary websites (written in poor English) with the goal of attracting people to their low prices. Notice how they cut off the faces of all the models in their photos of their supposed merchandise? That is because they steal the images of attractive garments from other retail websites, and the photos are more difficult to trace on the internet if there is no face. So they crop them.These scammer websites have one simple goal: They want your credit card number. Then, after they have taken your money, they will either months later send you something that doesn\u2019t even resemble the garment or accessory you thought you were buying... or, in most cases, you won\u2019t receive anything at all and you will NEVER  get your money back. You\u2019ve been scammed.ALSO, be aware that these scammers know these review sites like trustpilot exist, and they spend a HUGE amount of time writing fake 5 star reviews, talking about how great the products are and how fast they received their orders and how outstanding the customer service is. You can tell these glowing fake reviews are written by people who don\u2019t speak English and they all say the same thing. All lies.

I then placed another, larger, order on March 31st through PayPal.  It has not been received. I looked up their contact number: 1-909-281-0551, which was answered, and then disconnected - four times. I have gone to their web site and tried to enquire as to the delay - it will not accept the order number that was indicated on their receipt. This company advertises on AOL - which is how I found them. I then heard back from Rotita today, caller ID from the number above, listed Big Bear City, CA. At first they claimed that the money was never received and PayPal had not sent it. I pointed out that PayPal has a record of the order for $145.00. The man then confirmed this, admitting that Rotita had received the money and that his wrong information was a \"server issue.\" He then stated that, \"The item you ordered has been discontinued, so we will refund your money.\" I pointed out that I had ordered nearly half a dozen items, asking if all were discontinued - when they were currently still selling them on their site - listed as available in all sizes and which is advertised on AOL when I check my e-mail. He again stated that they have a, \"server issue,\" that is being resolved, and refused to acknowledge the other items. Instead, he kept stating that, \"The item is discontinued.\" I then asked about other items, asking about a seventh potential item I might like to order. \"Discontinued Mam.\" (Of course, I hadn't even indicated which item.) I asked that he refund the amount. He asked that I go online with him on the phone, taking me to a 'remote' site, instructing me to press the download button which would refund the money to me.  I pointed out that pressing the 'download' button would, according to the information he failed to disclose to me - yet was listed on the site he had sent me to, would give him full access, and control of, my computer.  I declined his instruction and he stated that, \"If you don't give me full remote control of your computer, then we will refuse to refund your money.\" After denying him access, I told him that I am reporting this - which I will definitely do. After the call ended (roughly 5-10 seconds later), I received another call, from 855-325-3237. The message was that the IRS was coming after me - a known scam. Are these linked? I then found this site, and wish I had found it earlier.  My sympathies go to those who have reported here about allowing access to their computer and the outcomes they endured.  However, it was useful because I found on this site the other number: 509-588-7320.  A man answered.  I asked for Alan (mentioned in review).  He stated that Alan was not there, identifying himself as John.  He confirmed that he represented Rotita and asked what I wanted, so I told him what happened and that I wanted my money back, or the goods that I ordered.  I mentioned that I found his number on this review site, and that the reviewer had expressed success to receive a refund.  He hung up on me.  I tried the other number mentioned in these reviews: 509-207-4166.  Nobody answers.  Area code 509 is Spokane, Washington.  I called the police there, but their lines are only answered M-F 8:30-4.  I will try as per those times.  Haiti also has a 509 code.  However, when you check Rotita's site, they have an address of Shanghai, China.  As I said, when I placed a small order, it came, and I really have no complaints with the first order.  However, the second order reveals what certainly appears to be a possible scam.  Also, I note other comments about the 5-star reviews being false.  I totally agree, and it changes the overall ratings.

It's really a shame that even websites like Amazon allow such shady companies to advertise on their websites.

The sides of the too small cup (I wear a DDD) stick out on the sides.  I would expect this if the cup was too big, it is actually a bit small.  The halter tops just have a loose elastic around the back that fits very low on the back and does not actually keep the front of the suit from showing your breast to anyone standing next to you.

Beware ROTITA Sells Defective Merchandise", "text": "I do a lot of my clothes shopping online but this was the first time I dealt with Rotita. I had gotten a catalog from Rotita and a few items looks decent and so I ordered 2 just to try it out. A few minutes after I had placed the order I got an email saying that my order should arrive in about 3 to 5 weeks. Curious about why it would take so long, I then saw that the merchandise was coming from China.  No where on Rotita's website does it say that they located in China.  Had I known that I never would have made this purchase.  And why? Because if either item didn't fit and I wanted to return them, I knew that the shipping cost to China would be prohibitive.  Anyway after 8 weeks I received the items and both items were damaged.  One had two huge holes in it and the other was a top that was pieced together and where the pieces were sewn together the fabric was all bunched up.  Also, both tops had unfinished hems - bottoms and sleeves - as if no one bothered to hem them.  I communicated all this to Rotita (through their website) and had to take pictures to prove the damages. Rotita's initial response was that they would give me $14.95 and I could keep the items.  I didn't want to keep these tops.  I would NEVER wear them!  The 2 items cost me $59.00, and so basically what Rotita was doing was reducing my loss by 25%.  I didn't think it was right that I should  pay anything for damaged merchandise.  When I communicated this with Rotita they came back with another offer.  I could keep the tops and they would refund me $47.20.  Now they were offering me 80% off.  And that would have been great if only I was able to wear these tops. When I rejected their second offer and told them that I wanted a FULL REFUND along with a free shipping label, they then came and wrote that they would issue a full refund after I returned the merchandise to them and they gave me an address in Shanghai, China.  They refused to give me a free shipping label. I then got a quote from UPS that the shipping would be $125.  Fed Ex was more. Frustrated, I contacted PayPal and in the end all PayPal did was communicate with the seller.  PayPal sent me similar emails - first an offer of $30 off, then when I rejected that offer, PayPal wrote to me that I could return both items to Shanghai and then they will refund the $59.00.  When I finally told Rotita that I would accept the $47.20, (without having to return the items) they said fine and that they would credit my account. That was 3 months ago.  Now they don't even bother responding to my messages.

The nice and flowy style on the pictures had suddenly become a very poor styleless mediocre piece of fabric with no allure at all. Even the colours were different. The coat and the dress showed no differences, both could have been called a dress, made of poor cotton as opposed to the advertised luxury linen. They had minute pockets (my hands couldn't fit in them although I ordered size large).Trying to get my point understood by Rotita's customer service was similar to a 15 season TV drama. Their emails are anonymous, stubborn and deprived of any form of courtesy. One wonders if their staff ever had any form of professional training. At no stage my 'ghost writers' have expressed sympathy or understanding in their emails, they seem to hide behind their internal rules, too scared to face the customer's request, ignorant of the meaning of 'assistance'.All they did at first was to insist on the good quality of their products, totally oblivious of my complaint and making me feel as if I was the 'baddie'. Basically I was wrong to disagree with them.After a long series of unsuccessful and sterile emails I threatened them to go futher and use my civil rights in order to get justice. Suddenly they replied with an offer (still no apologies): I could sell my items online (ebay!) and get a 'good price' out of it plus a 15% discount on my next purchase with Rotita (Noooo, please, never again!!!) or i could return the whole disastrous package with postage at my own expense (this is part of their policy and is visible on their page). So I did. I'd rather pay \u00a320 and forget about Rotita for the rest of my life. I am now waiting for them to refund me in full. Needless to say that I won't give them a good publicity in the future and I'll contact Paypal about this appalling experience. Rotita is a disgrace to the concept of online shopping.

The photos showed the dresses as flaring from the bust but the reality was the overdress was just a straight piece of fabric with no shaping whatsoever and no fullness. The grey one ordered was brown with a darker brown underneath which didn't go with the top layer. They looked like cheap market clothes that were thrown together. The fact that they make it so difficult to return and at a substantial cost leads me to think that they are well aware that their clothes are rubbish.

How about you keep your items and I help apply a 15% compensation to your user center? You can use the store credit for your next purchase. As for the items you got, you can gift them or donate them or sell them online at a great price. As you know, if you return it, it will cost you much for the shipping fee as you need return your item to China. And we issue a 60% refund for returned orders. The shipping fee and handling fee we spent on your order when shipping the order out, this part cannot be refundable. If you still want to return your items, we will send you the return address. So bottom line the thought of returning an item is a moot point with this scam! Beware, you will be ripped off.

My niece also bought 2 dresses from them for her daughter's Christmas present.There was no way of knowing (unless I'd trawled through the internet - which, of course, I didn't! What an idiot, eh?) that the dress came from Shanghai in China; there was no way of finding that fact out on their website; it's not mentioned! Only when the dress arrived did it become apparent that the supplier was in China due to the postage label including the supplier's address, etc. An alarm bell rang but, the dress looked so good, I put it to the back of my mind.Christmas Day came and the dress I'd bought from Rotita was obviously too small to be worn, even though the size had been checked using Rotita's guidelines.After much prissying about with Rotita's online \"Ticket\" system (emailing) for notifying them of a required refund or returning the dress, they agreed that, as postage to return the dress would cost around \u00a335 (slightly more than the dress cost), I should keep the dress and they would refund me 20% of the cost; not brilliant, but it was all I could get out of them.I was going to order another dress from Rotita for my great-niece when I received a 'demand' letter from TNT (the firm who delivered the dress to my address) for an amount greater than the cost of the dress; it appears Customs and Excise want their 'cut' because Rotita, presumably, don't pay the required tax for the items they send to this country. The total amount that TNT are requesting is 125% of the cost of the dress. So, we have a dress which is too small to be worn, I've paid out for the full original cost (as I won't be using the refund now) PLUS the tax imposed for postage . . . the total cost is 225% of the cost stated on the Rotita website!Unbelievable! . . . But TRUE . . . I must say that the two dresses my niece bought from Rotita fit my great-niece well but, as they were ordered later than my order, my niece's 'tax' letter hasn't turned up yet.If you're thinking of buying anything from Rotita, think twice; in fact, think 3 or 4 times.

DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!!! Yup, that's a good start. So I ordered this coat, that was listed a pea coat and on the inside it has fur (fake of course). So, it looked super warm for winter but yet still classy. I was super excited when I placed the order. It took about 14 days to come, which whatever, it is what is coming to the US from China and all. I receive the coat and what a disgrace. I felt bad for the fabric, having to look like that. It was not a pea coat, first off, it was scratchy rain coat fabric that only went up to my belly button, the fur was disgusting it didn't even line the whole coat. The fur was not warm and soft it was like a piece of grass and they didn't even put inside the sleeves. I tried to put the thing on and it almost ripped. I paid $55 for this coat too, not $3. So I email customer service, since their number is in China and they were hard to reach. It kept telling me they were not available. So, I ended up fighting with the sales department via email for 2 weeks. First they were rude and offered me 10% off something, after fighting with them about that they go we can give you a full refund if you return the product, I said not  aproblem what is the address. Then they give me the address and say okay once this item is received we will give you 60% off. WHAT THE FLYING EFF ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT DUDE!!!! First you go from 10% off a new order, to 100% refund to 60% refund. This is not even including what I will have to pay for shipping back to freaking China from USA. They are horrible unprofessional pathetic sad company. I bet a 12 year old in a sweat shop made this, disgusting. I am outraged. I am going to rate them all over the internet. Seriously, screw them. I am going to file a fraud on my CC for this product and if they give my any crap I will hire a liar to sue the hell out of them. DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE SCAM SCAM SCAM!!!!", "rating": 1}]

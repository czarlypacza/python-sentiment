This was a colossal mistake.While I concede that Figure has a lot of positive reviews, I find it VERY difficult to believe that many of them are legitimate.  I highly recommend that you pay very close attention to the negative reviews. My Simple Story:I was trying to use the equity in my home to consolidate an unhealthy amount of revolving debt, most of which had been accumulated due to medical expenses (Hooray USA!).  Like many others, I didn\u2019t want to do a cash-out refi and sacrifice a low finance rate on an existing mortgage.  This is why so many of us are turning to products like the HELOC.After clawing my way through Figure\u2019s online application process, I was ultimately offered a loan of only $20,000.  And\u2026 Well... That was actually perfect in my case.  I had no intention of borrowing more than $20,000, regardless.Some notes about Figure\u2019s online application:  It is entirely bot-based\u2014that is, unless you run into a snag and have to \u201cchat\u201d with an agent.  If that happens to you, be prepared to read this a lot: \u201cSorry, we cannot do X-chore manually.\u201d  The agent is no help at all and really just directs you down avenues that you\u2019ve likely already traveled.  In other words, unless everything in your application can be researched or confirmed via their bots, you\u2019re just out of luck.  Although my application finally made it to the finish line, something as simple as a 1099 could not be accepted or considered by Figure.  So the full complexion of my income was not recorded.In plain English, there is ZERO personal touch with Figure.  While I know some folks will like this, it will without doubt negatively impact a lot of potential borrowers who need a HUMAN to genuinely oversee the process.And then... 24 hours after being told I was approved for $20,000, I received a denial email.  Again, read the negative reviews and you will see this happening to a lot of people.  Many folks who are approved later receive a denial notice the next day.  Even wealthy, well-to-do folks with 800+ credit scores, excellent equity and good salaries are being denied for ridiculous reasons.  Figure\u2019s \u201ccan\u2019t do manual\u201d nonsense is likely the principal reason for all of these late stage denials.  With all of this in mind, the reasons provided to me in Figure\u2019s \u201cadverse action notice\u201d (their afterthought denial) were nonsensical and clearly not sensitive to the true purpose and complexion of my application.Also worth noting:  Within MINUTES\u2014not weeks, not days, not hours\u2014my phone was getting blown up by other lenders offering other loan products.  My information was sold by Figure before I had even finished the application.  I\u2019m not being hyperbolic here.  This genuinely happened.  About 25 minutes after I entered my contact and financial information, I received three back-to-back calls from multiple lenders.  Spamtastic.Figure welcomes anybody and everybody to apply.  Why?  Because anybody and everybody has data to sell.  Figure will make money off you, whether or not you secure a loan with them.  Consider that before biting into the apple.  Should Figure choose to respond to this review, I\u2019d recommend that you ignore the response.  I say this because they will likely either be vague with their excuses or will mischaracterize components of my application in an attempt to gloss over their own poor processing practices and/or to smear my character in an effort to soil my review.  Make no mistake: It\u2019s all protective corporate BS, top to bottom.  I deeply regret reaching out to Figure.  Their marketing campaign does not match their product availability or service execution.  Full stop.Be smarter than me.

Not good.Also, after waiting, they didn't even send the dumb Amazon gift certificate. If I were an investor in this company, I would run.Thank you for the reply Figure, but that is not true. This application attempt and re-attempt was in the space of a few hours and neither my property value nor credit score changed during this time. Your response here is fundamentally inaccurate and wrong, as your customer service representative lead that spoke with me could easily attest to.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Delayed (by over a week!)

Figure had great reviews and a three week turn around promise. Firstly, it took over 6 weeks to get the refinance done and another week to get the payments.  Secondly, their \"dashboard\" never did work correctly as it would tell you there was new information on the dash and then there would not be.  But mainly it was the completely enept customer service reps.  We finally got to a point where we were only speaking to managers and even then about half of what they would tell us was not correct. aIt was only after we threatened to post an honest review and go to regulating agencies that we got any quick movement.  They were even a full day late in the disbursement process.   Figure asked us to document our experiences and we were told they \"forwarded them to their compliance team\" but haven't heard anything as to how they would be fixing their issues or even why we had so many issues.  They did send us a t shirt in the mail saying welcome to the team.  We got a second one since apparently they can't track their free advertising merch any better than their mortgages.Now as we are setting up our information with the new mortgage company (because Figure sold the mortgage right away)  Figure  closed out our escrow account and didn't get the new company the correct home insurance declaration... are we suprised?  Not at all. Bottom line is... if you want to hand-hold a company and follow their process this is the company for you.  Otherwise find another company.Edit:. The \"we'd love to discuss with you\" has already happened.  Nothing was done.  I've submitted pages ans pages of documtation Ana talked with managers.  Nothing has come of it at this point.  So \"we'd love to talk about this\" is pretty empty.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Do Not Click Too Quickly!!", "text": "The user interface is clean and fast - perhaps enticing users like me to click through too quickly.  I never saw a disclosure that I was going to get a hard inquiry on my credit report.  If this disclosure was present during the quote process, it needs to be displayed with much greater emphasis.  This is especially true because you don't get to know all of the loan offer details until the end, after the hard pull has already occurred.  That was a real shame.Further to that point, I wanted to adjust my requested loan amount after learning about the add-on to my payment for insurance and tax escrowing.  Look, at the beginning of the loan quote process (the \"Payment estimator stage\") PLEASE include the insurance and tax escrow estimate in the payment!!! I didn't know about the escrow add-on until the end!  When I learned how much higher my payment would be, I asked my originator to let me adjust the loan request downward to compensate for this factor.  He told me I HAD TO PAY TO RATELOCK before he could make any adjustments to the requested loan amount!  Otherwise, I'd have to start all over and incur ANOTHER HARD INQUIRY in the process!!  For Pete's sake, I was just trying to ask for LESS MONEY like any responsible borrower should!In summary:- Know that the advertised, estimated payment at the beginning of the process is low-balled.  It will probably increase by at least 30-40% from an insurance and tax monthly escrow perspective, depending on your situation.  Just know that before going in.- Because, once you start, you can't stop or make any adjustments!!  Somewhere along the way, they do a hard pull on your credit report, and if you DO want to tweak your requested loan amount, it will cost you $$$ in the form of \"having\" to go ahead and \"lock the rate\".It's just too slick of a UX, with too few or poorly emphasized disclosures.And just an FYI, my current 1st mortgage does not require me to pay monthly escrow payments for insurance or taxes.  So while that apparently is a \"hard guideline\" for Figure Finance, there are lenders out there who waive that requirement.  They do not.  But you don't know they don't, until then end of the process and only then if you ask them.  Just saying.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "We bought 2 homes with Cash in 2019", "text": "We bought 2 homes with Cash in 2019, one in April across from a nice lake, and one later in November right on a Different lake that is only 2 miles from my office.  Both properties need some remodeling, and I received a prescreened solicitation in the mail for a quick 5 minute online approval with a reservation code.  The mailer was sent to my current address but was an offering for the smaller home I purchased in April and when I entered the reservation code into their website it populated the address automatically & wouldn't allow me to change it so I began a chat box with them asking how I could change the address to the home I purchased in November instead.  The employee who text chatted back instructed me to go back to the FIGURE home page and click \"find my rate\" to start a new application using the Address of the Home I wanted to get the HELOC on.  I did that, completed the new application, and submitted it.  Within a couple of minutes I was able to check the dashboard and was denied due to them being UNable to verify that I owned the property which I had purchased back in November 2019.  So I called in to them to talk to a human.  The first representative Brandon was professional but unable to offer any help other than the explanation that their entire approval system is digital and has no human overrides so he could do nothing.  When I expressed my desire to have my home location verified for funding he asked if I would like to talk to a supervisor to which I said yes.  The Supervisor came on in a few minutes and confirmed that the approval system is all digital and they have no way of inputting, title searching, verifying. correcting, nor verifying any home data it will happen whenever it happens automatically.  I shared with him that is unfortunate, even though this decision was based on a soft pull to verify my 763 credit score, it was still a waste of my time when I had planned on using my local bank anyways, BUT for once opened a piece of \"junk solicitation\" mail from FIGURE and then went online thinking this might be faster and easier... NOPE ...  Go with your own bank first whenever you haven't owned your home for a FULL year because their digital computerized system needs many upgrades before it will be able to recognize and verify the correct Title/Deed information to qualify anyone for a loan.  This is especially true when you are a CASH buyer and there is NO Mortgage on the property.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Low rates but miserable loan application processing", "text": "Figure had rock-bottom rates and that's the end of my list of \"pros\". Seriously, the only bank to match my Rate Lock was Quicken Loans (biggest mortgage originator in the country) and that was because they were on the hook for a $250 gift card if they couldn't match. The rest is a long laundry list of \"cons\". Their website masquerades as a modern interface, but behind the pretty purple design is a clunky, buggy UX which functions terribly. I haven't even closed, but I'm so fired up I need to record this somewhere.#1: They require sign-on verification of income and assets, which theoretically sounds good until it doesn't actually work. I was literally signed into my paystub portal and bank accounts in the same browser window, but couldn't log in through their Plaid-module with the exact same credentials. When I contacted customer service, she told me I was out of luck. The sign on verification was required and they wouldn't accept old fashioned uploaded documentation. HOWEVER, once I successfully signed into the IRS portal to verify income, that unlocked their ability to--what do you know!--upload W2s/bank statements manually.#2: In my Loan Estimate, they didn't require nearly enough prepaids for Property Taxes (they required 6 months but my annual bill was due within 2 months!) When I called, the CS rep told me that the servicing company would cover any shortage when it came time to pay annual property taxes. When I pressed her and asked why they would pay more than $1k of property taxes when they could just require it upfront, she said that they are motivated to keep a loan in \"good standing\". She wasn't going to change her answer, so I chatted online with another CS rep to get that statement in writing. After a long delay they finally told me that once they ordered title work, they would adjust the prepaid amounts to be accurate. **WOW** it's a good thing I can put 2+2 together and not rely on some under-trained--but confident--CS rep to provide accurate info. #3: THREE weeks pass from my appraisal's completion to the time I follow-up to see when I'll receive notice that they approved my application. Two days later I finally hear back from servicing indicating that I still have documents to sign, documents to provide, and \"proof of other loan application that was opened.\" What?? I double-checked both mine and my wife's dashboards. NO DOCS are available to sign. I also had already provided the docs she requested over 3 weeks before. And why do they need proof I applied to other banks as I was rate-shopping? That has no bearing on my creditworthiness. Just do your job and get my loan to closing. TLDR: They claim a fast closing process. It's a lie. If you want to go through this headache in order to obtain a low rate, go right ahead. But you've been warned.**Bonus tip: I work for a bank and they are in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, aka Regulation B, which requires the rendering of a credit decision within 30 days of a completed application. I provided them with complete information within hours and we're now within 7 days of that Reg B clock going off. If they don't get their act together quickly, you can bet I'll file a complaint on the CFPB's website.", "rating": 1}, {"title": "Shady as hell", "text": "Really, these shady people need to solicit their \"business\" to people who are not DEAD.

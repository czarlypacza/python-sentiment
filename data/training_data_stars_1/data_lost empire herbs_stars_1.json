I found the quality to be poor and lousy and that is the best that I can say about it. Compared to the product that I was already using, which name I will not reveal, I believe your product is just pure garbage. Please have it analyzed again. As a matter of fact I will be happy to have it analyzed for you and provide the results, after which you can provide me a refund of the analysis. Based on my free testosterone going up or Serene meaning level, it actually went down.I followed the directions explicitly as described on the package and they were encapsulated in gelatin capsules that were released into the intestinal area instead of being digested in stomach acid. I felt no different after two weeks. Consequently following these results I increased the dosage 25% and again felt no different then I did when I started the regimen.Later, in order to give your product the benefits of my doubt, I increase the dosage 75% which is almost twice the dosage and again felt no difference and after being tested, my free testosterone levels actually went down.In my opinion, and in my opinion alone, this product represented no benefit, and I believe that your positive reviews are made up or overhyped. Thus, I regret to inform you, I will never purchase a product from you again and if people ask me about my experience I will give them my honest answer.

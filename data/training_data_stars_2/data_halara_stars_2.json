Okay, I thought I can fix and when I started sewing I noticed that part was very poor stitch from manufacture company or whoever were sawing these trousers together.

Went to toilet and front main button pops off. And I was like ... what else now? Luckily I had long t-shirt that was hiding everything. Got home and fixed the button.On next day button popped off, because of my poor stitch. Im still wearing these trousers, but they are not worth that high price.

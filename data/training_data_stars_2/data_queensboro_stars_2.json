This has put me in the terrible position of possibly not receiving my shirts in time for an upcoming show.  I will explain:  I placed my original order on Monday.  It is now Friday and my order is still not confirmed, and I will not know it it gets confirmed unless I sit here in front of my computer and wait hoping I will get a response.  The original problem occurred when I forgot to add my son's shirt size.  Each day, before I leave I read their email and respond before I leave to go to my knife making shop.  I do not have a computer there, so I can't receive emails until I return home.  I have repeatedly asked the rep to please call my cell phone to straighten out any issues.  I have yet to receive a phone call.  Each day that passes, which is now five days, makes it more unlikely I will receive my shirts in time for my show.

They gave me a $15 credit for the inconvenience, and the hat didn't end up shipping until the 19th. When it arrived on the 21st, I was a bit disappointed in the fit of the hat, I assume its a one size fit all, but I'm not certain as I don't really know which product I ended up with due to the discontinued item thing. Either way, it's borderline unwearable as it's WAYYY too deep, essentially siting down to my eyebrows. It's also TIGHT, even with the clasp loosened it's still too tight - maybe I have a weird head but all of my normal hats fit fine. Overall I expect that had I received a different hat my review would have been closer to 5 stars, but the discontinued product, order delay, and fitment were a real disappointment for my first experience with this company.", "rating": 2}, {"title": "It\u2019s ok", "text": "While the pricing and quality of the hat is OK,  my first impression was that the stitching was overdone the logo size proportion seems wrong and it just looks a little hokey.

First, it took a very long time to get our initial order and it was not correct.

I waited about 4 more days for the additional produce and only received one more thing, not the three we were missing. I contacted the company again and they said they would make it right, also crediting our account to make up for it. I then had to wait 2 more weeks for the items. After two weeks only one more item came. When I check our account online it said that another package had been shipped out which came a week later. I don't understand why a company would would like that. You are making your customers wait a ridiculously long time for their product AND you are paying way more in shipping than if you would have just shipped it all together.

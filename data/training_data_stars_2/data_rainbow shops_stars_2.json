Please advise that in the return policy to let shoppers/costumers know. Then I drove another 10 minutes to return it to a mall that couldn\u2019t do returns because the mall was going under renovation by the following week. The lady seen my distress and seen that I drove two towns over so she went ahead and returned the items. Thank goodness for her. I had 9 other items I had purchased but 3 of the items ran way too small so needed to be returned.At the second store the people were friendly at the mall (Lafayette Square) but the staff was rude in (Speedway) they also need to have signs on the door that say WE DO NOT ACCEPT CHILDREN\u2019S RETURNS!!! Also to return by shipping is $7.95 which deducts from your refund or you can pay at FedEx upon arrival. Which that is another inconvenience because not everyone is close to a FedEx. I guess it was a better option then being compared to the gas I used driving over from Nowheresville to the city then making two additional stops. Rainbow on return policies please do better. The shipping was \u201cincredibly fast\u201d and there is a lot of variety on their website and in stores. If it wasn\u2019t for the horrible return experience and unreasonable staff (Speedway) I would of rated higher. It Seems to me the company wants to keep your money and make all sales final. I question if overall it\u2019s a demographics issue because I clearly seen who mostly shops at these stores. Which that itself seems discriminatory within itself that these companies treat you based on the overall demographics of the shoppers which is morally wrong. They didn\u2019t do this at Target, Abercrombie or Kohls when I returned things the previous day. Worse case scenario I would of disputed the items on my American Express Card. Hint* another reason why the lady went ahead and did the return. AMEX doesn\u2019t play around with companies/stores not honoring store return policies. Seems like Rainbow does this at a discretion.

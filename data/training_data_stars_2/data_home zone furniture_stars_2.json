They left very quickly and as we continues to look at the furniture, we saw all the defects and damage on both nightstands, on the dresser, and the bed slats were even broken! We immediately went to the store and explained the situation to one of the managers. We explained the poor quality and finish on the furniture. We showed them pictures and emailed them to him as he requested. He called the warehouse and the lady told him she would contact me the following morning to setup a new delivery date to replace everything. This was a Wednesday, and she said she could guarantee we\u2019d have all new furniture by Saturday at the latest! Thursday nothing. Friday by 1pm, nothing! We called and said to just cancel our order and that we wanted a full refund. We asked for them to come pick up the remaining furniture. They scheduled for the following Tuesday. Tuesday came and yet again they messed up.. they were bringing the replacements for the mirror, headboard, and footboard! We declined them and called to speak to a manager yet again. He apologized and rescheduled once again, this time for Friday. Friday came and they FINALLY picked up the remaining furniture from our home, and by the next morning we received an email stating we were refunded for our purchase. What a truly awful experience we had! The quality is horrendous for the price. We went to Haverty\u2019s and had an AMAZING experience from beginning to end! Received everything correctly and damage free. Quality of furniture didn\u2019t even compare to the HomeZone quality. And we only paid $300 more for the new set, same amount of pieces!!! I don\u2019t recommend HomeZone to anyone.", "rating": 2}, {"title": "Bad customer service", "text": "Date of experience: September 16, 2020", "rating": 2}, {"title": "Delivery experience leaves us wondering...", "text": "This was our first visit to Home Zone in Burleson.  In the past, we purchased furniture from Rooms to Go and Ashley, but we wanted to check this place out.Pro - furniture looks nice.  We liked the look of almost everything in the store, making it difficult to choose.  They have a variety of styles, and not all \"feel\" the same.  Some are more firm; some more soft.  Sales person was incredible.  Very patient and answered a lot of questions.Cons - Delivery options: free delivery for porch drop off or $150 for them to deliver and assemble.  This is a bit much, to me.  I believe our delivery fees have been anywhere from free to $99.  Delivery Date 1:  We chose the free delivery; didn't feel like we needed help putting a recliner together.  When the piece arrived, it was dropped off and the drivers left.  The very first part of the packaging we removed revealed a screw sticking out of the recliner!  We immediately called customer support to have it addressed.Customer Support: Stated that they couldn't schedule a replacement until the next day, because our order was in \"delivery\" status and wouldn't change until the next day.  On the next day, I called and they scheduled a new delivery for the next Saturday.Delivery Date 2:  Our time frame for receiving the chair was 9:30 to 1:30.  At 1:20, we still had heard nothing, so I called customer support.  They said they had to cancel the delivery due to inclimate weather.  First, I'm all for the safety of the drivers, and the weather WAS getting bad.  However, the company should have called us and told us rather than waiting for me to call them at the END of our delivery window.  The customer support person simply could not understand this absolute failure in CUSTOMER SERVICE, and simply apologized that the delivery was delayed.  About 20 minutes later, we received a call to notify us our order would be cancelled due to weather.  They don't even communicate with each other!  I expressed my frustration, and told them that we were seriously considering cancelling the order all together and finding a recliner somewhere else.  They called back about 2 hours later and said that the roads had cleared and they would deliver the chair.  I insisted they deliver and assemble to inspect the chair for issues and they did.In summary, our confidence in the quality of this chair is low.  It is inexcusablefor a company to allow a piece of furniture to leave the factory much less enter a home with a screw sticking out of the side of the furniture.  Whatever the assembly process is that allowed this to happen in the first place concerns us.

I missed half a day of work to wait on the delivery people, bc I was told they would not contact me when they were on the way, they would just show up any time during the window of delivery. When they didn't show up during those hours, I called the store, they specifically told me they were running behind due to another delivery, but that they would still be delivering the furniture. At 7:55, when they still had not shown up, I called again making sure they were still coming, since it was getting closer to 8pm, after waiting since 1:30pm. The salesman placed me on hold to call the delivery people, he came back on the line to tell me the truck broke down however they were on the way. Also when I called the store the only option where a live person would answer was the sales floor. The other options went to voicemail, both times I called. At 8:11pm the delivery driver calls me to make sure I will be home for the delivery, mind you I have been waiting since 1:30pm.

However the scuff on the dresser was too deep to cover up with the touch up marker. So they said they would make note of it and to call the store in the morning. They left, and we moved the chest in the bedroom, and noticed it was quite wobbly. So when I called the next morning, I told the sales woman who answered what exactly was wrong. She gave me a managers email to send pictures of the damage. I did so immediately after that call. The response email said someone would contact me shortly. That was April 6th, today is April 13th. I still have not heard from them and have not used the dresser or chest, bc I was under the impression that it would be a quick and easy fix. I do love the bedroom set, aside from the issues.

The delivery guys who by the way are paid by the delivery not customer satisfaction want to get in and get out as quickly as possible so taking the piece with them isn\u2019t easy. I bought a sectional with power and it was so crooked and didn\u2019t fit right. They attempted over and over yet were in such a hurry they didn\u2019t ever do it right and wouldn\u2019t take the piece in question. So a repair ticket was formed and they left. They were nice enough yet smelled like a cigarette factory so our redone room smelled like that for hours after they left.  Well my husband came home and said it\u2019s just not hooked in correctly and fixed it. Repair ticket was canceled. Well then we have a lot of family from out of town a couple days later and we went in there to use it for the first time-guess what the armless recliner had only one button to work it. The other had fallen off. So called and set a repair ticket because even though it probably can\u2019t be fixed without ripping the material and sewing they had to set up a repair.  Didn\u2019t care what i had to say.  Well it was for 6pm-8:30pm. Does no one care about family time anymore!  Work day ends at some point. Again we have family here and have had plans during that timeframe for weeks. So I called to change-well evidently they have only one person doing the repairs and he won\u2019t change. They were to call me back to get a new time but No one called back. I again called this AM and got a lady that helped me get the piece returned and replaced with a new one (Pearl).

I wanted to return them almost immediately, but especially after sitting on them for an hour. Much to my dismay, the website basically says that I CANNOT. It is now October 8, the sofas are not even a month old, and already the fabric is getting loose, and they are no more comfortable than when I received them. I am incredibly disappointed and sorely wish I had just gone to ikea.Edit- I do appreciate Home Zone reaching out to rectify this issue, shortly after I posted my review and then emailed photos of the sofas\u2019 several defects. (See response below.) However, the resolution was simply an offer of exchanging the sofas for store credit (minus the $200 worth of tax and delivery fees we paid and we would have to pay an additional delivery fee if we chose other couches), and we no longer trust the quality of items available there.

We were drawn to the quality and the features of the furniture. Each drawer is dovetail construction front and back, the drawers are cedar lined, there are a couple of hidden drawers that are felt lined, there are power outlets and USB ports inside the top drawer of the night stand, and there is a night light under the night stand which is activated by touching a little metal sensor on the side of the night stand. We were very excited to purchase this set.  There are no high pressure salesman at this store.  We were told right away that they are not paid commission.  We paid for our furniture ( $2,000.00) and set our delivery date. We were told to make sure to examine each piece of furniture once it was delivered and make sure the delivery men notated any damages.  This would ensure that we would have no problems getting the furniture replaced if need be.  Well, here is where I give this company two stars. The set was delivered on July 12,2018.  I looked over the furniture and realized that 3 drawers on the chest didn\u2019t close properly, and there were chips in the finish of the night stand and dresser.  I had the delivery man make note of this and he also took pictures.  He asked if I would like them to remove the furniture or to keep the furniture and do a swap. I chose to keep the items until they could be swapped for undamaged pieces, as my daughter had no furniture in her room, and needed a place for her clothing.   Apparently this is where I went wrong!  He mentioned that I would receive a call from the company to schedule a swap by the following day.  I did receive the phone call the next day.  The lady I spoke with asked me to send her photographs of the damage... I watched the delivery driver take these photos, why didn\u2019t she have them???  I went ahead and took my own photos and emailed them to her.  She returned my call after she looked at my pictures and told me \u201c Per upper management they want to send a technician out to try and repair the furniture instead of replacing it\u201d  I told her there was no way I was keeping damaged furniture. She said\u201d  I understand  your frustration, but the chips are small, and the drawers can be adjusted\u201d   REALLY!?  I didn\u2019t pay $2k dollars for chipped furniture and warped drawers! I didn\u2019t purchase the floor model set on scratch and dent discount!   I realized that I should have REFUSED the delivery instead of doing a swap. We went back and forth in a few phone calls and they still wouldn\u2019t set up a swap until a technician came to at least try to repair the items.  I was told that if the technician cannot repair the items to my satisfaction, they would move forward with a swap.  I made clear that if it wasn\u2019t to my satisfaction which I already know it won\u2019t be, because there is no way he can repair the chips and make it blend in, or do I believe he can adjust the tracks of the drawers because I can see the drawer fronts are warped. That I will not keep damaged furniture!  She set up an appointment for the following Tuesday or so she said. When I received the email for the appointment, it was for the following week!

The hassle should have been with the third party delivery service that would have caused the damage during transport and set up.

Bryana, our sales associate, gave us considerable help when requested, and the space to shop alone, when needed.  The quality of our furniture is top notch, was delivered on time and with no complications.  Kudos to Bryana and to Home Zone Furniture.  We'll definitely send more business their way.So, after our furniture was delivered, we decided we'd like to purchase another recliner to finish off our living room(we mentioned this to Bryana during our purchase).  We called the Mesquite store in an attempt to order one for pickup, seems easy enough.  However, the store is not allowed to accept orders over the telephone, and require you to place the order in person.  Now, mind you, we just purchased a full living room set earlier in the week and had it delivered.  We requested a manager be notified of our request, but we were still unable to place the order.  So, we are off to make an unnecessary trip to the Mesquite to buy additional furniture in person.   I had to drop my review from 5 stars to only 2, since the Mesquite store was unwilling to help us with buying additional furniture from their store.  Go figure \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14Thank you Home Zone Furniture for replying and informing me that I am able to place an order online using my credit card.  I attempted to do just that yesterday, before returning to the store.  While attempting to complete the online order, we found that the recliner could not be shipped to the Mesquite store, and the nearest one available for shipment to is in Euless, TX, which is quite a distance from our home in Forney.  We went back to the Mesquite store and placed our order, still unhappy with the process.  Upon arrival, a sales associate & manager explained their rationale for not allowing orders over the phone and that is was to prevent fraud.  I tried to explain that having the recliner shipped to the store and allowing us to pay for it upon pickup, should not cause any issues regarding fraud.  Our original sales associate, Bryana, although on duty, did not involve herself in our discussion or show any concern over our complaint.  We plan on picking up our new recliner on Tuesday, and will put this purchase and dissatisfaction with HomeZone behind us.  Unfortunately, when friends and family seek referrals for home furniture purchase, we will not be able to, in good conscious, recommend they shop at the Home Zone Furniture in Mesquite.", "rating": 2}, {"title": "Good customer service but lacking in furniture quality", "text": "Out of the four thing my mom and have bought at homezone the only thing that has not broke is the metal bed frame.

The day of delivery, Saturday, we get a call that the dresser and mirror were damaged and would be reordered and brought to us on Thursday. We were glad they checked it so we let that roll off our shoulders too. The 2 gentlemen arrived in a very timely manner and worked VERY hard to get our stuff put together. The delivery guys realized the WRONG foot board was sent when they were trying to set the room up. So, needless to say, We are without a bed for 4 days. We had already given our bed away the morning of our furniture delivery. We have always had an excellent experience in the past with Home Zone.

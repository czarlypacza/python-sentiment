Ensure representatives communicate clearly and verify all critical details upfront to avoid costly assumptions. Never make assumptions about the nature of funds without proper verification.3. Provide consistent and timely updates throughout the process to reduce client stress.4.

I am my fathers power of attorney, and his home is in trust. He was diagnosed with lung cancer last year, and we needed to refinance his home, because my mother passed away last year, and he just couldn't afford the mortgage payment on his own. I was tapped out on my savings as I had quit work to take care of my mother as she battled chronic and severe illness. I reached out to the first Rocket agent, and he took too long to even respond, so I tried to reach out again. I was able to speak with another agent, and I communicated the situation, and that, as my father's POA, I wanted to get his home refinanced for him. The agent said that the process would likely only take a couple of weeks. Well, a couple weeks turned into almost two MONTHS. I had to submit and then re-submit our POA documents as they were somehow unable to be found in the system, then I submitted our trust certificate, THEN was told I needed to upload the trust in its entirety. At that point I became frustrated, and had some questions about the details and numbers of our loan, and the agent I was dealing with said he would check on those numbers, and get back to me later in the afternoon. I didn't hear from him again until a week later, and he didn't reach out to answer my question. He reached out because he had a question about our trust. I reached out to Rocket to ask for another agent or to just call everything off, and was then put in touch with someone higher up that was brought in to help salvage the situation. We got to the next step where we had to deal with amrock, and the woman there was quickly replaced when neither myself nor the Rocket agent helping us could get answers from her, as she didn't seem to be too concerned with helping us. After that I was told that the doctors note I submitted for my father wasn't sufficient. I was forced to get THREE additional doctors notes as each proved to be insuffienct in different ways, despite the fact that I did exactly what was asked. We started this process on February 12th, and our loan didn't close until the first week of April. All I wanted to do was help my dad stay in his home as he battles cancer. It was made clear from the beginning that we intended to use our POA to refinance his home, and we were met with road block after road block in the form of either apparent disinterest or miscommunication. Rocket seems to be so compartmentalized that once a person gets their job done, the case is sent downstream without any context or communication. I don't understand how agents told me that everyone involved was \"on the same chat thread\", yet the whole process managed to be so incredibly disjointed. I will say this, agents that I spoke to were respectful and showed some empathy for what my father was going through, but, the road my father and I took to get his home refinanced through Rocket was the exact opposite of a smooth and enjoyable experience.

We have never had an issue with our old loan (we refinanced during the rate drop with Rocket and had a great experience). When we went to purchase our new home, we shopped for rates, and found Rocket was one of the most competitive. Our Loan Originator (Aaron Nason) was INCREDIBLY helpful. He listened to what I wanted from our loan and was able to get us a good rate. He even helped answer questions throughout the process and helped me understand closing costs (and went to bat for us to try to understand why we were getting screwed out of so much $ by Rocket--see below). Literally, if I was only rating Aaron, it would have been a 5 star review. Fast forward to submitting our documentation; it was a complete mess. The processor (Star) was really sweet,  but sometimes struggled with explaining what the underwriter wanted from us. We submitted EXTENSIVE documentation (we had a gift, numerous financial statements, W2s, etc.) proving we had more then needed, but still were told to resubmit THE EXACT STATEMENTS  (so that the underwriter would actually look at them) again to prove our funds. This became incredibly frustrating, since we overall had a super straightforward loan. Finally, got through all of the documentation. Star was very sweet and very patient; I have submitted a review separately for her, but she would also get a 5 star review. On to the closing process, which was absolutely a miserable experience and should be completely unacceptable. We were advised (by Rocket) to purchase our insurance in advance of close and pay directly to the insurance company. This lowered our cost-to-close. We then received a 5K sellers credit and had about 1K in Rocket rewards to go toward closing costs. We submitted ALL of our insurance documents 6-days before close, and received a prelim cost-to-closing statement that still included $2,700 charge for insurance. I was the one who caught this mistake (after I had asked multiple times for this to not be even included from the get go since I was already working to purchase it) and IMMEDIATELY requested this be removed to get an updated cost-to-close. Mike Capaldi assured me it would be removed before close and my costs would be updated. 36 hours before close, I received a call from Mike telling me that because I purchased insurance separately, I did not have enough closing fees and had an excess of closing credit and would basically be missing out on $1,700. I was informed that usually I would be asked to buy down the rate, but since it was so close to closing, that if I did this we would have to push back closing (which is not an option as we needed to vacate the house we were selling on the close date). Meaning that I would basically be leaving $1,700 on the table. Being told this was incredibly frustrating and completely unacceptable. We negotiated for that $ for repairs on the house and were expecting to use it to do so. I submitted my insurance information 6-days in advance and Rocket decided to wait until 36-hours beforehand to basically tell me I had no options at that point since closing was so close and that I basically would miss out on it. We ended up having to purchase a home warranty (which we never wanted and do not expect to use) and worked with Mike to get our Rocket rewards $ back so that we could instead use our sellers credit. We ended up missing out on a few hundred dollars, but Rocket's inability to change our closing costs to give us any options after 1) I submitted documentation 6 days in advance and 2) I CAUGHT the mistake immediately (about 5 days in advance) was just shockingly disappointing. We were then given updated \"final estimated\" closing costs the night before close. Then ON THE WAY TO CLOSE, we received a call telling us that those numbers were not accurate and increasing our closing cost about $2,000. To not receive accurate closing numbers until LITERALLY 15 MINUTES BEFORE CLOSE is so stressful, disappointing, and overall just wrong. We basically had no choice at that point but to move forward, regardless of how much money we ended up leaving on the table. Any push back from us, and we would have literally been homeless with a 16 month old baby, while I am also 17 weeks pregnant. Overall, just really disappointed in how the close was handled.

The loan processor told me this was impossible for all the differing accounts, but I could pay of the vehicle myself. All the others need to be paid in the closing as a condition of getting the loan. He also stated all the loans would be paid by electronic payment so there would be no delay. I have refinanced before and this was not a condition so it took me by surprise, but after some discussion I agreed. To my great surprise I learned in the closing documents that the payments were not to be paid by electronic payment, but paper checks would be mailed to me and I had to mail them to each debtor. Not a good time to learn this. My choice is to either except it or cancel the loan and pay back all the cost of processing the loan. This mailing to myself and then me mailing to the debtor added several days to the payment process. This time delay added interest cost on each loan.  Then to add insult to injury when the checks were mailed to myself, they were mailed without the requirement of a signature and the mail man just lest them on our porch while we were gone.

My main complaint is that they should be way more detailed in just exactly what all is needed as far as documentation and requirements to close the loan, provide a time line for when these will be needed (and when updated versions would be needed if things get delayed). If they do as many loans in the US as they say they do this is a no-brainer. NOTHING should be left to last minute or surprises.

Shame on me for allowing this to occur twice.Just to be clear, the appraiser considered the best comparables were a house that was clearly obviously not similar in construction or age and was liquidated by Open Door at a price cheaper than fair market value and another house that needed extensive updating that wasn't even in my neighborhood. We later provided 3 more properties for an additional review and for some reason the appraiser made no changes, even though we provided a recent house that is just two houses away, actually in the same neighborhood (unlike their initial comparables), and is obviously similar in quality of construction, size, age, and condition. This appraiser ironically is also a real estate agent and I wonder what advice she would give me if I were to list my house for sale with her as the listing agent. Would she say I should sell for $456,000 or would she rather me sell around $600,000. I knew prior to starting this that the refinance appraisal would not be the same as the selling appraisals, which by the way magically come in right above the asking price of a home, but I did not foresee that there would be over $100,000 difference. And I understand attempting to minimize risk associated with loans, but the business practices deployed by Quicken/Rocket regarding refinances with the constant phone calls and graphics when you are in your account are now very questionable to me. Also can you please remove the \"Estimated Home Value\" graphic from my current online mortgage account. Even with a disclaimer it should be considered a bad and misleading business practice considering the appraisal came in at $456,000 and the fair market value according to my Real Estate Agent would be a minimum of $600,000. Run that through your legal department and I am sure they would agree or add even more to their nice little disclaimer.", "rating": 2}, {"title": "High pressure shady sales tactics", "text": "I contacted rocket about a refinance and they were super high pressure like a cheap used car salesman.

Our loan specialist during the house hunting process was awesome. He stuck with us over six months of house hunting and being out bid on 7 homes. He would proactively call agents and discuss how well qualified we were, and we were second place on three different houses even if we weren't the second highest offer because of his ability to ensure a quick close. My one complaint is that the time zone difference often made some deadlines tight and stressful in our super competitive market where every little detail in the offer and how the offer is executed is scrutinized.  On our 8th house, we finally had our offer accepted! This is where things have gone down hill. We submitted our loan app, and all documentation within 24 hours of winning the house. For some reason, the closing specialist had our closing date set for Feb 24. I connect with her, told her that wasn't the date we discussed with our LO and not the date that was in our offer. She said she'd adjust it, but I never saw the updated date on our account and then she told our insurance agent the 24th after the conversation where she said she'd make the update.  The date I thought we were set on to close was Feb. 15th, but we were then told we would have to push back three business days due to the appraisal completion report date. We executed an amendment with our sellers to push out the close date to 17th per that conversation. We, somehow, are still not cleared to close despite the sellers and us scheduling the closing, and being told we could close the 17th.  I was told we are missing tax transcripts which was confusing since we signed the documentation to have them pulled on 1/27 and turn around time for an electronic request of transcripts if usually 5-10 days. We are going to have to push out closing again, and now feel like we are at risk of losing the house. The seller's have an all cash backup offer and have made it very clear they don't understand nor are happy with these delays. I just feel like there is not an understanding of the risk the buyer assumes in pushing out a closing in scenarios like this nor a sense of urgency or any type of research done to push for a quick close. I feel like we are just one in the queue and that however we got stuck with the Feb 24th originally is supposed to be fine, regardless of our individual case.Edit to add: Still no close and probably going to lose our house over tax transcripts.

I filled out a survey and was given someone else. He was better for about a week. He knew of our situation (husband has a new job, waiting for a paystub) but didn't communicate his leave of absence to us. I only found out when I emailed him after a few days or not hearing from him & got an out of office notice.I was then referred to the Team Leader, who was quite helpful & corrected all of the misinformation our rep had given us. We were on the right track. Until we got to the 'senior purchasing specialist' who is not knowledgeable. About anything. She has yet to reply to any of my emails and never returns phone calls or calls me when she says she will. But when she needs something, she calls, emails, and texts & I have to do it ASAP. We're supposed to close on the 19th. Our appraisal isn't until tomorrow (16th) which pushes our closing date out until the 22nd now. I wouldn't have known ANY of this had I not called in last week. I paid for the appraisal mid October and inspections were done by Oct 20th. The appraisal wasn't 'ordered' until 11/2. Knowing these things take longer due to the influx of loans they're working on, you'd think it would be ordered as soon as the inspection was done. When I said this, I was then told 'no, it wasn't accepted until then.' No. We were told by several people it wasn't ordered. Maybe this is their practice not to order the appraisal for weeks, but that's inefficient as well. Our closing date is now pushed out 3 days. Not a huge deal as I expect the appraisal will be fine. BUT the lack of communication on our specialist's part is unacceptable. I've had to call her any time I want to know anything. She doesn't return calls after I leave messages or email me back. Same with my husband. He's left her a few messages. It's not hard to reply to an email even if it's \"I'll get back to you\". The specialist doesn't know how to explain things in a simple manner, nor does she have any answers to most of my questions. I've resorted to emailing the team leader from a few weeks ago and she and another rep are helping now and I expect our specialist is aware of this now since she called me.I've signed an appraisal waiver, which I forgot to mention when I spoke to her. My understanding of the waiver is it waives the 3-days we have to wait between appraisal & closing. It's not really clear as I don't do this for a living. I left her a message about it and I don't expect a call back. However, I will NEVER use Rocket again. Getting passed from person to person is annoying. Getting an email every time I talk to someone and be asked for a review is annoying. I think the process is inefficient and the new person you talk to doesn't seem to know anything we're doing, any special situations, nothing. It's like they don't make any notes or don't read them before speaking to you. I also feel because we're not spending tens of thousands of dollars, we're not a good customer. Sorry if I'm moving to an area that's poor and the houses are cheap. This review may be a little disorganized, but I'm so tired of the whole process. It shouldn't be this hard to purchase a house.

The process was frustrating, but understandable.  Thus, when we considered buying new home we called them first.To put this in perspective, this our 10th home loan.  My company moved me around the country a lot, so we are quite familiar with lender practices.I gave them a complete view of our finances (income, debts, assets) and our intent with the loan.  We were completely open.  They said there would not be any problems approving the loan we were requesting.We give them six weeks to close the loan -- \"an eternity\" in their words.After uploading tons of documents (well over 100 in the beginning, I think we loaded almost 200 in the end), and four weeks into the process, they began questioning whether our income was sufficient.  Two thirds of the way into into eternity!  This notice came to us on Friday after 5:00 pm.  By Monday morning I thought I had satisfied that need, but it dragged on for another week!  One week prior to closing, again on Friday after 5:00 pm, they had questions about our business operations with respect to COVID-19.  This was something they could have asked to resolve with the first document dump.  Had they asked earlier, they could have gotten what they asked for.  However, with just a few business days remaining prior to wiring funds into escrow, they threw a curve-ball that was extremely difficult (actually impossible at that point) to meet.  I was able to write them a letter explaining our business plan and enough supporting detail that they ended up accepting the situation.  We never actually received a loan approval letter, only a letter giving intent to fund the loan two business days before close of escrow.The people we talked to were professional and dealt with our extreme frustration excellently.  However, they were not kept informed as to what issues were being addressed and could not really keep us well informed.  Thus, the customer service score is misleading, as the people were excellent, but the company policies and underwriters were the issue.I think that Quicken was trying to shop the mortgage around to buyers.  The new buyers had their own policies which were then foisted upon us at the last minute.  I find this practice to be highly unethical in that we incur huge expenses through the purchase process and then find out that the loan is at risk up to the last minute.  If the loan had fallen through we were facing extremely high costs to carry out the purchase.  Had we known there might be issues, we could have worked with other lenders, but we were not informed until it was too late to work with other lenders.  Just a lack of ethics on their part.We also had all the usual frustrations of uploading the same documents multiple times.

These reasons gave a very bad first home buying experience.", "rating": 2}, {"title": "I felt that there were many things that\u2026", "text": "I felt that there were many things that made this process frustrating and problematic.  There were lost documents and we were constantly uploading documents that we had already uploaded.  My employer was called multiple times to confirm employment which is embarrassing and annoying.  Our cash to closing fluctuated greatly and we never really knew how much we would have to bring to closing until the very end.  I got a phone call from the specialist who was working with us that told us we had a closing date and how much we would have to bring.  4 hours before we needed to be at the title company to close we were told that we couldn't close and had to push it to the next day.  During the course of moving a household with two little Kids the \"jerking\" around was almost too much.  The people I spoke with at Quicken were pleasant and led me to believe they really wanted to work with us, but It really was a hard process.  Up front information would have made this process much more smooth.  We are not just a name and numbers on a computer screen.  We are real people who are trying to pack a house, work, live, pay bills and move 170 miles away which is stressful enough.  I have purchased homes before and I value the personal side of things and looking someone in the eye.  I didn't get that here.", "rating": 2}, {"title": "Frustration Aplenty", "text": "Loan origination was a good experience and went smoothly and quickly. Quicken seemed to not know how to close it. My employment is unusual being employed overseas, and they could not reasonably deal with that. It took more than a month for that step alone, in spite of daily calls by me all the way from United Arab Emirates at my own cost after the second week. It would never have closed if I had not finally been referred to the executive offices for assistance on the day I was going to stop the whole process if it did not move to ready to close status. Donna Hunt made this happen, but could have, and should have happened much sooner if Quicken really was passionate about my satisfaction. The closing occurred as finally scheduled, but then we were called to say that something was wrong in the closing paperwork and some forms needed re-signing. After that was completed, the check for our proceeds was left on our porch without signature even though I specifically said it must be signed for.  This is at least my 4th loan with Quicken, but this experience was so bad and just plain frustrating that I wouldn\u2019t do so again. If a call is desired, Quicken can email me and I can call. They would not be able to call me.", "rating": 2}, {"title": "For two people who have a credit rating\u2026", "text": "For two people who have a credit rating of 804 and 759 respectively we sure hit some turbulence trying to buy this house.

Anyways, I went through the application and got my rates, which unfortunately were higher than at least half of the other local banks and lenders I had contacted (I am in Denver, and am a very well qualified candidate 820 credit, good income, 20+% down etc) so no big deal I just took them out of the running... Problem is that over the following couple weeks I kept getting daily credit monitoring alerts from someone running my credit (not a good thing when you are soon planning on obtaining a loan as each inquiry causes a slight points decrease) so I called the credit bureau who the requests were going through who directed me to Rocket Mortgage. So I called Rocket to request that they quit running my credit and remove my account. After being transferred around to 4 or 5 different people who had an extremely difficult time even finding my account, I was essentially told that their is nothing they can do and that they are unable to delete me from their system... So yeah, that kind of sucks. Guess I just need to cross my fingers and hope that they stop... Just wanted to warn others to not waste your time.

My order was cancelled due to lack of availability on Chrono24 side. I replaced the order after hours of customer service calls and they did something on the back end to help. The seller (My Watch LLC) was the most unprofessional, disgusting individual EVER!! I cannot believe that someone would be so snappy, short, and disgraceful to a customer, yet alone someone spending over 20k sight unseen online. Seriously?? I ask questions and I should have the right too, but DO NOT COME AT ME when I do!!  I have every right to ask questions before, during, and after the transaction.  Would you smack a child when they took their first steps because they asked questions?? The seller probably does, but this is not the place to berate a client.For example, the watch was advertised as full box box and papers, new, unworn. I expect that to be exactly like it would coming out of a Rolex store. NOPE! Not the case here. It was sized down to a very small wrist when I got it. It did not have the plastic bezel cover on it either. Nor did it have the clear envelope that houses the warranty card/manual. When asked My Watch LLC about it he stated that it was not in the pictures and he didn't have it. It was advertised new, unworn, full box and papers so why should I be the one to police these details?!! I trusted this to be reputable, but BUYER BE WARNED!! Better ask every single question AHEAD OF TIME!!!I believe the platform needs work. If you are an international company then someone should be available 24/7 to cover all time zones for assistance when needed. It took me several days to reach someone.

Watch went $700 worth of bad after 2 weeks and they won't let me change my review, so that others will be warned against the seller, who so far has done nothing to recompensate me and likely won't. (Update 3-6-23: They were willing to refund $375).So, an irresponsible seller gets away with it and will continue to do so all because you won't let me warn others against him OR extract the money he owes me for the repairs. Chrono24 doesn't take PayPal, so buying internationally is an absolute effing nightmare with my credit card company.As a result of the above and from now on, Chrono24 is where I shop ... but only to find what I want and the name of its seller. Then, if I can't buy from them directly, I find it elsewhere, as Chrono24 has done nothing to deserve my business. Suck on that.................3-6-23RE: Chrono24's reply.It happened after 14 days. Understand? The watch was so gummed up that my watchmaker, a retired Omega employee, had to scrape & clean the casing and clean every single part, change the seal, reassemble it, oil it, adjust it, timegraph and pressure test it.My watchmaker said the seller's watchmaker probably just added oil to existing oil to get it to run. It was not properly serviced 2 years ago, as advertised (which I blame on the watchmaker, NOT the seller) and my watchmaker said he would not be surprised if sat around unwound and not running for 2 years.It cost $700 to overhaul. The seller felt this extremely exorbitant. Tough. That is beside the point. That's what it cost and I'm sure as hell not paying $200+ to ship it back to Italy for his bogus watchmaker to \"fix\" it.So, I settled for the $375 they were willing to give me, because it's all in their hands and I have to settle for what the seller is willing to give me. However I don't feel good about being out an additional $325 in repairs mere weeks after its initial $3,500 purchase.See, receiving what I didn't pay for isn't right. My having to pay $325 ($700 if the seller said go kick rocks) to have something fixed only weeks after I purchased it is not right. The seller did what they we're willing to do and I settled for it with no other choice. So, things are all fine and good between me and the seller.However, what's right is still not right. It seems to me Chrono24 needs to pick up the $325 slack through some sort of insurance or fund that they hold for such matters. My approach to Chrono24 will remain as stated above.

Chrono24 showed me a price in USD from a US watch dealer, and I thought I was paying in USD, so used my USD bank account. Actually, they charged my bank in Euros, and my bank charged me a fee.

If you're in for the luxury watch purchase, you do not have too much choice, so you should be warned and prepared.1. If you do not have a physical watch dealer of particular brand at hand who has certified watchmaker and can fully test your watch right away - do not even think about buying the brand through Chrono24. They will not protect you against anything other than obvious things like visibly broken watch or wrong piece. Given the spread of super accurate fakes I would not risk buying many of the watches (like Rolex) from Chrono24 at all, especially from private sellers.2. For whatever reason Chrono will bombard you with emails trying to make you admit you've bought something you did not. Not only it is annoying as hell, but if you contact more than one seller with same/similar item, Chrono24 will try to make sure you've bought all of the items, even if they are still with the respective sellers. Be very careful. For example, even if you press \"I did not buy this item\" link in your email, you'd be led to a big green button confirming that you've bought the item. Not sure why they do that and what does it say about their business model. I once did something like that and soon I was bombarded with calls from some bad mannered lady who ignored the fact that she just interrupted a meeting and after I pointed that she could have scheduled a call she became pretty rude and pushy. 3. Chrono24 does care about sellers much more than about buyers. For example, if the seller is rude or does not reply or lies to you about the watch - you can't do anything about it. The seller will still be there, \"working\" without problems. What if the seller gave you wrong information, forged papers or anything? It's your problem - but the seller will remain there untouched and you will be spending money on any of possible complications further down the road. 4. Until you really have nowhere else to go - be VERY careful about vintage watches. Some sellers do not hesitate to lie with a smile. If anything feels just a bit sketchy - do not proceed with the purchase. Chrono24 will not do anything against seller retrospectively even if the seller did something bad: if you where unable to spot the problem immediately - you're done.I wouldn't believe I would recommend eBay for buying watches (and I do not like it still), but their initiatives to protect watch buyers seem to be much better then  Chrono24 at the moment. Which is pretty sad, given that Chrono24 started so well and had some great potential. I mention this not to promote eBay, which I'm far from being a fan, but just to illustrate how some develop and innovate while others just relax. Also, if not for eBay checking on every watch now I would possibly put at least three stars for Chrono24.I must underline that I do not suggest that Chrono24 is all about scum sellers or fake watches. There are a lot of great dealers and a huge selection of watches, but buyer protection actually covers the delivery for the most part, so one has to be very careful and remember that to a huge degree and in many scenarios buying the watch on Chrono comes close to buying watch on the forum or social networks. Chrono24 does relay money so the watch has to be delivered and has to look like a real deal, so most obvious scum is avoided (thanks!). But anybody who would want to play dirty with faulty parts or long term defects - Chrono24 is a platform to fool the buyer and then some.PS: some math for perspective.  Out of 24 watches bought on Chono24, 4 where faulty in some form with sellers often plain lying about little or big things. Out of these 4 cases only 1 was resolved with Chrono's help. PSS: the latest vintage watch with a problem, which I'll have to bring to the dealer for a full service and pay by myself, magically appeared again from the same dealer. I thought I was lucky to find almost NOS piece, but I suspect the dealer has access to parts and from the manufacture or does something else pretty shady. Not sure I will be able to anything about it, 'report suspicious listing' is my inly option but even then I't be hard to even explain what makes it suspicious. So the dealer will continue to operate until next guy will buy the piece and again dealer will remain operational while buyer will most likely fall victim. Because Chrono24 is protecting dealers, not buyers.", "rating": 2}, {"title": "Very very good", "text": "Very very good.

The differences were small, but still a difference which neither the seller, nor you wanted to recognize, while the watch wasn't cheap at all. I have approved the transaction and also reviewed the seller because I wanted the watch.  My intention is to understand if I can trust your website for future transactions or not.Although, I have provided you with clear photos and explanations, and you could have also checked the product's description from the sellers announcement or simply verified directly with the watch producer what can or cannot be a normal state of the product delivered, you have simply decided to not give attention to the facts and just forward an explanation already exchanged between me and the seller.I have to admit that comparing to your slogan, I am deeply disappointed by your reply and actions. You just disregarded simple facts and common sense supportive documents that should accompany an original watch. Thus, considering your first argument that a hand made product should have defects, totally disregarding the definition of a hand made product and the quality it is supposed to have ... it would mean that if I buy a Patek Phillipe Turbillon watch which is a hand made product or a hand made suit or a hand made assembled car, one should expect malfunctions and defects ... because it is hand made?!? The \"hand made\" tag means everywhere in this world, the perfection and most precise attention to details, thus, exactly the opposite of your understanding and reply below and to the reply that a professional and official seller of watches delivered as argument and excuse to receiving a different quality product than the one presented in his announcement. Another remark in your reply was related to the handbook of the product. Have you conducted even a minor check on this?!? Do you really believe a top product can be sold without its proper handling instructions and that a renowned manufacturer can provide only a general handbook to a specialized product without explaining its functions!?! I have sent you pictures pictures presenting the handbook of the Pontos S Diver watch, showing that this watch has its own dedicated manual and not a general one, as the seller said and as you seemed to support the seller's affirmation! On the same topic, your other recommendation below was to have a look on the watch's warranty card ... if you have read the dialogue between me and the seller you would have noticed the seller said the watch doesn't come with a warranty card, while it should have had to, being an original product accompanied by its original documents (as shown in its description). I have other Maurice Lacroix watches and all came with warranty cards, all being bought from Christ dealer in Germany during different years. Another aspect mistreated from your part.Concluding, the facts are that we have a description for a new, original without defects watch, accompanied by its original box and original papers, that in reality came with a threaded bracelet, without its original handbook and without its warranty card, On all these differences you concluded they do not exist or if they do they are normal and there is no case to debate upon or issue to a claim. Considering all the above reflections and supported arguments, I just cannot understand how or if you really screen the sellers and even more, how you handle the complaints ? Do you even have the minimum knowledge and information to deal a complaint related to your main activity ... watches? How can one trust future transactions for top rated watches on your website when you do not pay attention to simple facts considering the presented incident?I really look forward to your reply and explanations.Regards,", "rating": 2}, {"title": "Disappointing", "text": "Disappointing!

And a couple said that the watch could not be shipped to my destination... which was Monaco and one dealer was next door in Italy and the other in Germany... and one of these replied over 3 weeks after the offer was requested.In the meantime Chrono24 kept sending me automated emails asking my feedback about how the negotiations where going. I replied about what was going on and half expected a call or a reply. But since then nothing form them. Yet they kept sending me emails asking feedback....I finally went with one of the dealers who said the delivery time would be 2-3 weeks (ilo initial advert 3-6 days), as on calling him he confirmed a supplier had the watch in stock.That was 3 weeks ago and still no watch. The Christmas period hasn't help and an excuse that the supplier's delivery company never picked up the watch. But I was promised it would then be sent directly to me. Arrived home today new years eve and no watch...I called Chrono24 before Christmas, the first time there was an automated voicemail to say they could not take any calls for the day...Reached them the next day and explained the whole situation and they did nothing more than say they \"understood my frustration\" but there was nothing they could do. The one good thing, I complained about the endless feedback requests and seems they stopped these...Have sent emails to Chrono24 today and received an automated response that as their \"marketplace becomes more and more popular\" they wont reply until 7 days....Despite all the nice watches they have advertised I wont be recommending Chrono24 to anyone based on my experience...

Having used the site before I gave a great review... however my second experience was the opposite. The following review is not to be interpreted as malicious/sour grapes. From a professional standpoint the dealers involved in this experience shall not be named... so here goes...Firstly, if you use Chrono24 do your due diligence on the seller - as Chrono24 do not appear to vet them whatsoever.My story goes like this... I purchased a watch from a seller in Germany, and asked prior to purchase if there were scatches/defects. I was told no, and the watch itself was advertised on Chrono24 as '1/mint' and 'unworn'. When I received the watch, it was sent from Latvia. It then turns out the dealer was based in Russia (so I actually purchased from an affiliate who had never seen the watch). I checked the watch, and the movement was ok. However the deployment did not work and there was a scratch/chip on the lug.When the affiliate was slow to respond to my issues, I contacted Chrono24 who told me they would generally intervene and come up with a fair solution before the money was released to the dealer. I felt this was fair, and said that I wanted to keep the watch as I had ordered a new deployment. I had photos and confirmations from the actual watch manufacturer and their UK distributor confirming there was an issue with the deployment. After this I was only ever told to return the watch (which I would have to pay for myself, and it would only be refunded once the dealer received the watch in good order). My level of trust was gone. I suggested a fair solution would be for a contribution toward the deployment and compensation for the scratch/chip - my suggestion was what it would cost the dealer for the watch return to Latvia (c\u00a380) and for Chrono24 to offset their sales commission for allowing a dealer to misrepresent a product on their site. Still a lot less than the cost of a new deployment, however this outcome would share accountability, and would be a reasonable and equitable solution.It was not to be... I was again told to return the watch at my initial expense, to be refunded once the dealer confirmed everything was ok.The bottom line:- Be careful- Chrono 24 are very dealer centric, and do not seem to have a duty of care to their customers/purchasers.- A commission is more important than a satisfied customer- They do not vet dealers- They allow misrepresented adverts- There is no recourse or penalty for dealers that sell items that are not honestly described.- Customer service/experience has infinity to go before it reaches the level of Amazon or Ebay.Good luck with Chrono24, and don't forget to cross your fingers (and toes!)", "rating": 2}, {"title": "Everything was good except for payment verification time frame.", "text": "Everything was good except for my payment.

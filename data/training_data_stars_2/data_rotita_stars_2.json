Cheap tacky material, nothing like what they look like in the photos.

How about you keep your item and I help apply a 15% compensation to your user center? You can use the store credit for your next purchase. As for the item you got, you can gift it or donate it or sell it online at a great price. As you know, if you return it, it will cost you much for the shipping fee. And we issue a 60% refund for returned orders. The shipping fee and handling fee we spent on your order when shipping the order out, this part cannot be refundable. If you still want to return your items, we will send you the return address. This is the reply I got on the Rotita complaints procedure, and this is the reply I get on here. As you can see two different answers!!!Thanks for your feedback. We have been devoting to offer good products with low price, but it maybe up to your expectation. So you could return anything you want, under the condition it's in original condition. Postal service is a good way to return, and I suppose it\u2019s not much expensive.

I got very concerned that my data privacy was being violated by this company.It took a lot of work to find the place on their website to submit a Help ticket, and they keep trying to make it difficult by giving an \"Did this FAQ solve your problem?\" response instead of opening a ticket.I got the same (poorly written) auto response multiple times, and then they tried to ask if I wanted store credit instead of a refund.  I think I was able to get the full refund, but only because I cancelled within 24 hours, otherwise they were going to make me pay $3 per item for restocking (and many of the items were under $5).Today I got the following email:Hi, dears,Sorry to interrupt you!

So, I went to Google, looked up \"Rotita Reviews\" and voila, here I am...GLAD I DIDN'T COMPLETE THE ORDER.In reviewing many of your reviews, I started thinking back to an order I made through a different company that was advertising on Facebook. I saw a dress in the advert that I absolutely loved, and wanted to order it for a Phi Theta Kappa Induction Ceremony that I was to participate in. Well, let's just say that I never got that dress, and I was out $40.00. Rotita's website smacked of a similar scam, and now I see that my intuition was spot on. One thing that really gripped my attention was the deep discounts offered for otherwise pricey clothing. I also noted the size charts, and they seemed to match up to my measurements (in inches, not centimeters). So, when I read Rotita's own responses to your complaints about sizing, here on TrustPilot, I noted that they had the nerve to say, 'Our sizes are Asian Sizing, so check the size chart.' Well, if their sizing are Asian Sizing, then a XXXL isn't going to accommodate a 44in. waist by any stretch of the imagination. Seriously, I get that these people want to provide fashionable clothing to  at a deep discount, but global shipping is an art that you must master before attempting to try it. It sounds to me as though Rotita either hasn't mastered it, or doesn't care if they master it or not.I will not trust my debit card information to a company that is not only this shady, but has stabbed countless customers in the back. A company cannot succeed without its patrons, and Rotita would be wise to keep this in mind. Good customer relations means a successful business. If you're incapable of providing international sizing, then it is best you do business within your own country.

I will try to keep my long story as short as possible, but a lot happened. I ordered a shirt on August 2 and it was supposed to have shipped August 5. I constantly checked the tracking to see its progress as I was very excited to get the shirt. For a week it did not move from China, nothing was updated, I didn't know what was going on. On August 11, I called customer service and asked about it. The guy I got stuck with said it was out of stock and they had no idea when it was going to be in stock again. The page didn't say anything like that when I ordered and the checkout process went perfectly fine. So I asked if we could cancel the order and get a refund. He said yes and he told me I had to install a program in order for him to get the refund going. It looked like some kind of remote access and I asked him if he was going to control my computer. I don't know if it was because he was foreign and confused or he outright lied to me, but he said no, it was nothing like that. Turns out, he did remotely access my computer. No refund process needs to remotely access a computer. At that point, I was really nervous about it. We got to a page that I had to fill out for the refund form and one part of it required the last four of my social. I asked about it and he said it was just part of the process. I didn't want to, but I filled it out anyway. After that was done, he cleared my browser history of the pages we had been on. He said he would call back later to continue the process. This first call was about 24 minutes. You should be able to get a refund going  in less time than that, and just with a phone call. None of the sketchy stuff he was doing.He requested that I leave my computer screens up after we hung up. I told him I would not do that. After remotely controlling my computer, I wasn't going to trust him to leave anything on it alone. After that, I uninstalled the remote access program, although I figured I'd probably have to reinstall it for our next phone call. I also shut my computer down, trying to take the most safe approach as possible after that. When he called back, no surprise, I had to install the remote access again. After he was on my computer, he installed something else that made my screen go black. I couldn't bring my screen back with clicks or pushing buttons on the keyboard. I couldn't see what he was doing, but I knew he was doing something. If he wasn't doing anything on it, there would be no reason to block me off of my computer. Also, my computer made the occasional ding noise. This conversation lasted about 1 hour and 8 minutes. I'd say at least an hour of this time my screen was black. He didn't talk too much during this. He asked me a few questions, like verifying my birth date and my address. I don't know why he needed a birthday. He also had five verification codes texted to my phone that I had to repeat back to him. He claimed they were part of the verification process. Three were from PayPal, one was from another company, and the last was from a third company. On the occasions I asked him questions about some things, he was very vague in his answers. When he finally let me have my computer back he said the return would show up in 24 hours and he would have to call back another time the next day for one more verification code.After that, I uninstalled the remote access program and went about my business, checking various websites I have accounts on, like my bank's website, email, Facebook, etc. My email came up with a message that my emails were being automatically forwarded to someone. I changed that immediately. Later I noticed all of my spam and trash had been deleted. I think he was on my Facebook account. I proceeded to change my passwords to everything I could think of - bank accounts, Facebook, email, Ebay, PayPal, etc. I am getting a new debit card because I don't trust him to not do something with my card number. I haven't seen anything funny on my bank account yet, but I'm not taking that risk. A while later I looked at my browser history to see if he maybe left anything from that day on it. But sure enough, whatever he'd been on had been cleared. I looked at the tracking on the shirt again and it had progressed to Illinois. Now I really didn't know what was going on. Was the shirt really on its way or was that part of a scamming process?The next day, I looked for my refund. It wasn't there. He called multiple times that afternoon and evening, but I didn't answer. I was not going to deal with him again. Who knew what else he was going to do? He was very persistent the next 3 days, calling a few times each day. I didn't answer any of them.August 14, I got an email for a refund on PayPal for a website I didn't make a purchase from. I looked at my PayPal history and there were about five transactions that took place on August 11. Some of the company's names matched the names in the verification code texts. I didn't make any of those purchases. However, what I couldn't figure out is where the money came from that he used. It wasn't my PayPal money - I didn't have any in my account - and it wasn't out of my bank account. Later I contacted PayPal and they worked on clearing that up for me. It seems he opened a PayPal credit account on my profile.August 15 my shirt arrives. It looks nice and fits. The material faded from white to blue to black in the picture but the shirt was mainly just white to blue. That's about the only difference I saw. I washed it once in cool water and hung it to dry and it seems to have made it through alright. There were no washing instructions with it.I don't think he call on August 15, but the day after he may have tried one more time.I really like some of the other shirts they have on this website, but after this, and reading a bunch of other reviews, I'm not sure about buying from them anymore. I don't know if I want to take that risk that something doesn't work for me and have to try and get a refund again. I'm sure there are other customer service employees other than him, but what if they're all up to the same shady stuff? I don't know if I'll be shopping here again.", "rating": 2}]

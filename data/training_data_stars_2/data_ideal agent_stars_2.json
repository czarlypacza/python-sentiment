We did have a few set backs but at no fault of our agent. Our percentage we paid was reasonable and much better than what we would have paid working with another agent/company. The Assigned agent, Liz Nguyen was very helpful in staging and ensuring we did things to the house that would attract potential buyers. Our house was in excellent shape, it was regularly maintained. It looked better than a new home which also made it attractive. All in all, great team work with all involved.

We have reviewed Idealagent many times before, and do not want to review them again, because our reviews have not changed.

They would not entertain an offer which would have netted us $8000 more dollars, money we could have sorely used for our new home.

However I do not expect to pay the buyers fee if the listing agent does not sell the property.My interests was not met, although I have accomplished  listing the way I  as the owner wish to sell my property.good luck to all selling their home.

If they give you a unmotivated, disinterested or I-don't-care agent, you will go through the process on your own. I was assigned an agent,  who overpromised and greatly underperformed. I was selling my mother's home and the agent believed that her work was finished when the buyer signed a contract. And she told this to me in a heated phone conversation that I had with her at the end of the process. Just about everything that I asked her, she would come back at me with the words \" I am not a lawyer \". Early on, I realized that if the sale was to be completed, I would have to get it done. I basically figured things out along the way. Definitely, this was a bad experience to say the least.", "rating": 2}, {"title": "This is a bit hard to review because I\u2026", "text": "This is a bit hard to review because I believed the hype and really did not receive 5 star customer service. First, we did not get the best deal in the end and still paid over 4% commission, where I believed that would be the top rate.Second, I am thankful for being proactive and reading everything on the contract as there were multiple errors our agent did not correct or even bother to read or warn us. We did the corrections with the title agency and were disappointed our agent was behind the curve.Finally, we asked our agent to help us look for property and a builder. She did say she \"knew\" someone, but never followed up. I at this point would not recommend our agent nor Ideal Agent.

I would recommend them to everyone. Job well done!", "rating": 2}, {"title": "Disappointing", "text": "We had a few issues with our agent. We felt he did a minimal job. He made promises to take care of a few issues that was never accomplished. We did not know until we would go to the property but he said he kept forgetting. He personally never showed the property to potential buyers. He sold us on using him after saying that they sold a house in two days with seller paying only 2% commission because they sold the property. After 4 months, he never had one potential buyer which is disappointing. He debated with me on a few issues that I felt he was focusing solely on what would be good for the buyer. He even asked me after closing was DELAYED 3 days for the buyers if it would be okay to allow the buyer to move in early because they had all the movers ready. We\u2019re liable for anything that would have happened. My husband and I were very disappointed by that question. We closed a few days early but when it came to buyers closing, we received several missed calls/texts on the day of their closing saying they immediately needed a document signed. The document was the sellers closing settlement. A very important document they needed signed fast. We ended up scrambling to sign and after review, we noticed several mistakes. These mistakes took more money away from the settlement amount. They tried to tell us that we agreed to it, but since they knew they did us wrong, they corrected it. They even admitted that they were there to help the buyers. Guess what? You just lost any other potential business you might have had with me.", "rating": 2}, {"title": "Not satified", "text": "Date of experience: June 22, 2019", "rating": 2}]

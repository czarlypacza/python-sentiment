I don't know if they would do business with me again, even though this transaction ended up being proper, legal, and not fraudulent.

All the items were great, with the exception of one thing. If you are considering ordering a commercial hood here, don't! The sales staff do not have the required knowledge to help in markets across the country. I am in MN and my salesman sold me a hood that is illegal here. I would suggest using a local company, as they know the local codes, even if it costs a little more. The consumer should not be required to read all codes and know them. If there is a so called sales specialist, it should be their job to know the requirements.\r My other annoyance has to do with payment. If you are custom ordering something or getting custom pricing, then this is not the place for you. My salesman would email estimates, I would confirm the desire to order, then wouldn't hear anything! I guess it is my job to track down the salesman to buy something? Last I checked, when someone wants to give you money, you should be seeking them out. I felt like I was working to place my order, not acting as the consumer. Everything that is custom has to be ordered by phone, so this is where my issue was. I guess the entire process was just far too difficult. To really put the icing on the cake, my salesman would very rarely call me, or return a call. If I didn't call him, then nothing would happen. Even then, nothing happened. I would ask questions, but never get any actual feedback. Just frustrated I guess! \r Stick to the standard stuff and you'll be just fine! Also, know what you are ordering, because the sales staff doesn't!", "rating": 2}]

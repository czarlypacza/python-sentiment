Both times were very smooth and easy. This time we refinanced and cashed in on some of the equity in our home to pay off some debt and get some other things done to our house. Ladele Andrew Tojuola handled the process. He did so with the utmost dignity and integrity. He made the process very easy and smooth. He brings credit and honor to the Admirals name and New Day USA. I mean that with all sincerity. He was very understanding and worked with my time constraints. I work a part time job and my wife and I have a disabled daughter that requires 24/7 care. Ladele could not have been more understanding or have done any better than what he did. New Day USA and the Admiral can and should be proud to have him as part of the team. He was out standing. Now for the vinegar. We refinanced our home with New Day USA for the first time some years ago. I don\u2019t remember the exact date. We didn\u2019t have any problems with New Day USA after they took over our mortgage. Then our mortgage was sold to Freedom Mortgage. Honestly my wife and I felt like we had been thrown under the bus when Freedom Mortgage took over our mortgage. It was one problem after another for about the first year. They said we made late payments when we were on time. There were problems with the our taxes and other fees in the escrow account. It was not a pleasant experience to say the least. I know that mortgages are bought and sold on a routine basis but I hope we can stay with New Day USA this time. Admiral Lynch if you get to read this I know you are a man of high standards, morals, and integrity. The service you provide to the active duty and retired military community is second to none and very much needed. I know many that have their mortgage with you and your company and they love it. Here I am a retired USAF Master Sergeant telling a retired USN RADM to keep up the good work, but keep up the good work. The service you provide is needed. There are veterans that wouldn\u2019t have a home if it wasn\u2019t for you.

Good show Anthony.I reviewed nearly all of the 300 comments you have received recently - both good and the complainers. May I add a comment to the complainers?1.  The loan process (even from Newday) is a business (it is NOT a free giveaway of monies to   Vets).  Businesses need to make money like every other business in America.  It takes time and effort to see if you qualify;  yes, even you.  You, like the rest of us, need to QUALIFY for the loan, whatever your circumstance in life.  I am sorry if you did not make the 'muster'.2. Ask them what YOU need to do to better your situation to enable you to qualify for 'something'....it may not come out to the multi-thousands you wished, but it is a start.  Remember: You are dealing with a businessPersonally, I did NOT ask for the 'maximum' out of what I may have qualified for - I asked simply for what I needed to help me get several high-interest credit cards nullified to get my debt load under \"better\" control.   Newday did exactly that.I hope better days ahead for you and yours.Gary O  Captain (Ret)", "rating": 5}, {"title": "The company made the experience easy\u2026", "text": "The company made the experience easy from day one.

I never told him that but,Cam was right, not a scam. He was able to coordinate from his office all communications in a timely manner.

I found a fellow vet to assist in the work necessaryCam touched base every couple of days to check and offer support of the project. I have become less than trustful of \"Great Deals\". Cam helped assure the process was a \"Great Deal\" for me/us. I was 110% sure that Cameron would get me to the finish of the new mortgage process. My concern were my deadlines. Cam worked probably harder than the next person to keep me on track. He is a thoughtful,consumer friendly Account Specialist. I believe that if Cam could work with me, he can work with anyone. He was also a great listener of my extensive stories about past/present/future. Great hire New Day !!!!!!

I called the 1-800 phone number and received a callback the next day from Collin Nutt. He explained to me in detail how the process works and then I decided to go ahead and apply. I also wanted to pay off some bills as well as doing some home improvements. Collin  explained to me that New Day USA pays for an appraisal of my home. I was pleasantly surprised at how much my house appraised for. The entire process from beginning to end was relatively easy and painless. Collin insured that I understood the entire process and answered my many questions. I\u2019m very impressed how streamlined the entire process is and I\u2019m so very happy that I decided to apply! Not only did I pay off some creditors, but I can now fix issues with my home and some home improvements which will build equity in my house!

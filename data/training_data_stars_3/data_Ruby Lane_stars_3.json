This is only applicable from a tax perspective if a seller is selling an excess of $100,000 per year on the site. Also, our margins are extremely tight. To charge a 6.7% across-the-board is unacceptable. If a $1400 Item cost a seller$1000, the margin after monthly fees and listing costs is less than $400. Then you take 6.7% $93.80 leaves a seller with very low returns. In actuality you\u2019re  consuming up to 25% of a sellers profit.

They may have social media websites, however, they are all free for everyone.  In addition, when one joins Ruby Lane they offer no support to sellers, such as, featuring new sellers possibly weekly, allowing buyers to see what new sellers have joined and what they are offering.

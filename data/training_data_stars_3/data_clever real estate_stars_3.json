[{"title": "Worst home sell experience eveer!", "text": "Update to my review:Though my experience with Clever was less than ideal i can honestly say i was surprised and impressed with Clever's response to my issues. The Co founder and CEO of Clever, Luke, actually reached out personally to discuss my situation with me. Unfortunately, Clever was unable to fully compensate for my loss; however, I do feel Clever did everything in their capacity to address my financial damages. In retrospect I would consider utilizing Clever's services again with the provision that, in the case of potential divorce or separation, specifically in my home State of Texas, one seek legal consultation before proceeding. Below please find original post:I don't know if I could have had a worst experience. The sell of my home was delayed by well over a week due to Title Company misidentification of the property for sell. NOTE:  I owned two properties, one property consisting of 1  acre lot with 400 sq. ft. portable building and second property included 5.2 acres with 1500 sq. ft. house. Five acre lot plus house was listed for sell, Title Company prepared closing paper work for 1 acre lot and portable building causing confusion and delay in closing process. *Very important to note here that I owned properties before marriage.* At the point of closing Title Company informed me that as closing was in the State of Texas spouse would have interest in proceeds from sell even though property was owned by me before marriage. After consulting with attorney regarding pending divorce I was informed that information provided by Title Company was INCORRECT in that spouse has absolutely NO interest in property owned before marriage. This misinformation, unfortunately cost me over $75,000 in proceeds from home sell. I look forward to working with Clever in resolve this issue and be compensated for my loss.", "rating": 3}, {"title": "We sold the house - but I did the pricing and negotiating ", "text": "I guess that our agent - because they were earning a reduced commission - was lowballing all the way.  Hoping for a quick blue-bird. - promised \"professional\" pictures of the property. Agent was talking about they taking the pictures.  Then only posted 5 pictures, (I asked for more),  - suggested a listing price below market - we went with MY number, - suggested we accept the first offer - I countered at a reasonable difference between asking and offer price - made a big deal out of items in the inspection report.  After I read the report - I found a few items that were reasonable concerns and offered an equitable concession. BUT - we did sell the house and we DID pay a lower commission - so all is well.

I usually get 1% of sell price if I do most of the homework myself. Here you won't get more than a few hundred. I am fine if the agent can be very helpful, though. Not sure about that yet, but two days later, I started to get a few dozen unrelated junk emails a day. That email I used is only for certain matters and I rarely receive junk emails. Only clever and the two agents know it. I don't think any of them would intentionally release my personal data to others, but as IT professional myself, I am concerned how well my data is kept.

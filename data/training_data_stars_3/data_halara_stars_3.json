I read a lot of reviews and inspected all the brand photos and reviewers\u2019 photos of each item. One issue that I have found with this brand is that the items can be very hit or miss in terms of quality. Based on my experiences, I find it difficult to recommend the brand as a whole and choose instead to recommend specific items. This time around I ordered 5 items, many of which I had had my eye on for a while. Out of the 5 items I was happy with 2, satisfied with 2 (though needing alterations), and unhappy with 1. The HalaraMagic high waisted denim midi skirt I\u2019d rate a 5/5! Super comfortable, great stretch, and very flattering. I know that long denim skirts have been trending lately, but they\u2019re far outside of my personal style so I was hesitant to try this skirt. First try on, I wasn\u2019t very impressed but once I figured out some outfits to use it in I was sold. I have found it surprisingly easy to style and can not stress enough that EVERY time I wear it out I get at least one compliment from a stranger. I have recommended this skirt too many times to count in the short time that I\u2019ve had it. The Floor length Sweetheart Neckline long sleeve dress is very comfortable and flattering. The material is sturdy BUT seeing as it is heavy it does tend to pull down slightly making it a little harder to support with a small chest. The fabric does cling to the body so the proper undergarments are important. It has hidden pockets which is a nice addition for comfortability and practicality. I haven\u2019t had the chance to wear this one out yet, but my boyfriend gave it a high rating. Classy and stylish dress. The Breezeful backless floor length activewear dress was one that I had liked for a while and based on the positive reviews I decided to purchase. Overall, the dress is pretty flattering but I have some issues with the top. The straps are not adjustable which means that for me, the top hangs just slightly too low making it look awkward and pushing out my armpits too much for my liking. The strap thickness changes mid way which I\u2019m not a fan of as it adds to the awkward/cheap look. I am waiting to see if I will be able to shorten the straps to fix these issues before I can actually wear this. I know that there is a long sleeve version of this dress, I would probably recommend looking into that one instead as the spaghetti strap design on this one is poorly executed. The V Neck short sleeve jumpsuit was disappointing. The fabric is very thin, which may prove to be beneficial for extra air flow during hot months, but it looks very sheer on the hanger. I ordered it in black because I did notice in some review photos that the material did look a little sheer, I don\u2019t notice too much of an issue when the jumpsuit is on (with black undergarments) but I don\u2019t think I would risk purchasing this in a light colour just to be safe. My main issue is again with the top. I ordered this thinking it looked conservative and professional in the model photos. I sized down to a Small as it looked a little oversized, the top is MASSIVE, NOT SMALL CHEST FRIENDLY. The V neck, which looks like it goes down to about the breast bone in the photos, extends down to my navel. I wish there was some kind of button or clasp to keep the top pinned shut as I will have to sew one in myself or wear an additional shirt underneath this in order for it to be wearable in the workplace (or anywhere really). Overall, it is workable but not the most flattering to begin with and in need of alterations, so I would not recommend. Finally, the ruched backless, tie back split hem body con mini dress was incredibly disappointing. Admittedly, I made the assumption that this dress would be the same signature \u201cathletic\u201d fabric as every other item I\u2019d ordered from this website based on how it looked in the photos, so that is on me. The item is more of a cotton/nylon type feel which means it lacks the structure that I typically like in Halara\u2019s items. The top of the dress should be a straight/square neck based on the photos, but the one I received looks like a wrinkled cowl neck. The neckline sags no matter how tightly I tie the back, and the bow at the back seems to loosen gradually which makes the top worse. The ruching on the straps just makes them look as if they\u2019ve been sewn in folds so they sit uncomfortably and slide off with any movement. I took photos to submit in the app review but the app would not let me add them. I have kept it in the bag and am looking into the return process to see if the cost to return it will be worth the hassle. I was most excited for this dress and was so upset to have paid so much and had high expectations for something that was unflattering and not the quality that I expected.

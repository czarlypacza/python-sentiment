I purchased a plan via Aardvarkcompare for Seven Corners Choice travel insurance. I have spoken to two Aardvark agents, and chatted with several more. All were informed about the policies and knew exactly how to help me (including helping me understand the coverage, and helping me change the coverage dates after I purchased). They communicated directly with Seven Corners on my behalf. All good things.  HOWEVER, I had to call Aardvark again because the dates of birth for the covered insureds were ALL wrong (for all four of us!) when I received the policy from Seven Corners. Additionally, the wallet ID receipt-of-purchase amount lists the incorrect total for our policies (not sure if it matters, but with insurance, I don't want to mess with anything being incorrect in the documentation). I would expect Aardvark to have communicated this information correctly to Seven Corners in the first place AND to check the policy to make sure it was written as requested. So far, I would not consider this 5 star service, from either Aardvark or Seven Corners. And of course, the true test of service would be assessed if I needed to use the policy.", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Beware of follow-up spam", "text": "Once you provided your email address, you'll be flooded with follow-up emails -- it's ridiculous.", "rating": 3}, {"title": "The bottom line is whether the\u2026", "text": "The bottom line is whether the insurance coverage ACTUALLY works.

When I called to get further explanation of the policy, the call was taken in a call room with many people in the background talking.

I hung up and re-dialed the sales team and was on hold a long time again until I gave up and hung up.  No idea what to do next. Luckily I can cancel the policy if I never am able to get clarification on policy questions.Update:  No one has contacted me. Update: No one has contacted me. I have questions and am unable to get answers. This is a very stressful experience.Update: The AARDY agent called me and explained that I purchased the Travel Guard plan through their agency. I should have contacted AARDY instead of trying to call Travel Guard, which is what I had been doing. The agent indicated that Travel Guard has long wait times, but AARDY answers their phone right away. My issue was learning that 100% of the trip cost must be insured through Travel Guard within 21 days of the pre-book payment to maintain the pre-existing medical condition waiver. The trip costs include anything pre-booked (like hotels), even if you do not plan to file a claim for that booking. I raised my one-star rating to 3 stars since this survey is an evaluation of AARDY, not Travel Guard, and the AARDY agent was a real person who really tried to help.

All representatives were helpful and knowledgeable.  The process was good.However, I have had innumerable problems dealing with your website and email.My husband I share an email address and all communication comes to him and is forwarded to me.  I am the one who does all technical computer work for us.  I have never had a problem with anything like this before.  I received several emails from you, but not the Confirmation of Benefits.  I called today requesting it and they said they had sent it but would send it again.  It never came.  Then I went to my husband's computer and there it was.  So I forwarded it to me, but it never came.  And when I went back to my husband's computer, it had disappeared. !?!  Luckily, I found the first email you sent a week ago which he hadn't opened.  It had never come to me.  I saved the attachments as documents and tried sending them to me again.  They never came.  So I shut down my computer to see if there was a problems with it.  Turned it back on, but again, they never came.  So then I opened up the file once again on his computer and printed the documents out (all mega pages!) so I would at least have them in print.I sent another test email with just a short message from his computer to mine and boom! it came immediately.  What is up!?  Now that I've wasted two hours of my morning just trying to print out one simple sheet from you, I am not a happy camper.  Oh, and I also tried to create an account with the link on the attachment email so I could login to see if the docs were available there.  Nope.  Links took me around and around asking where I was going with the only box available to check was where to send your quote.  Tried it 4 times.

Usually I read reviews if using a new site but this time I was swayed by the pictures of the clothes. Upon reading most of the reviews on Trustpilot I started to worry about my forthcoming order. They arrived today so I will share my experience. They arrived, as many have said, in a black plastic bag. Upon opening the bag, all three ordered items were in cellophane.  They all needed a good iron. I ordered the White high low turndown collar button closure dress, size XL at \u00a321.91. It was a bit of a struggle getting it over my head, it just fitted, I could have done with the next size up. I shall not be returning it because of all the hassle I have read about on these pages. The material is 65% cotton &35% polyester.  I need to snip off threads.The next item was the long sleeve pocket design maxi dress, size XL for \u00a329.33. 65% cotton, 35% polyester.  This is a very baggy dress so it fitted with room to spare. Again, I need to snip of threads but this item is ok. The pockets are higher than in the picture. The dress is a crossover which is not apparent in the picture, I am not keen on the crossover neckline but I can cover that with a scarf, unfortunate, but wearable.My third item was the turtle neck, long sleeve asymmetric hem, plaid straight dress for \u00a318.12. again this is baggy so it fitted. This is the only item with a tag with instructions on caring for the garment. The material is thick but no tags to tell me what the material is. It looks like a cotton mix on the outside but it is lined with a thicker polyester/nylon type material.After reading the reviews on this site, I consider myself one of the lucky ones. I think this was due to the fact that two of my garments were very baggy. Beware if you order close fitting items, if you want to risk it, go bigger but having said that, it is best to take note of all the disappointed people who have taken time to write to Trustpilot about their experiences with Rotita. Like I say, I was one of the lucky ones, order at your own risk. The the black bag it arrived in, the return address given is:-Mr HU CNEUnit 3Skyport Trade ParkSkyport DriveHammondsworthMiddlesexUB7OLBMany have said on this site that you have to return stuff to China at a hefty cost as they will not accept returns to this address so again, beware. I have written the returns address down as if you are still considering ordering after all the bad reviews, it may be worth contacting the above address to see if you get a response to any queries you may have, but again beware, you may not get the truth. I am just going to wash the white dress I have ordered to see how it washes and irons. Any problems and I will be back online.", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Lovely material", "text": "Date of experience: November 29, 2017", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Sizing is off", "text": "Date of experience: January 25, 2018", "rating": 3}]

Why still same mistakes?", "text": "I never thought in a million years I would ever purchase a car online without seeing or test driving, but I have to say it works.  I also would've loved to rate my experience higher, but the communication was TOUGH.  The review score of a 3 ( in total for Driveway)- is only because the car is super nice. I have to say I did get a beautiful car out of the deal - but it was very stressful at times.   I think the whole point of using an online dealer is to AVOID the hassles of a dealership - which was my thought process going into this.  Because of this - I believe Driveway is only shooting themselves in the foot - and losing a large clientele because you will never earn their trust with their current reviews (38% - Rate only a 1) with communication being the common complaint. THIS WAS MY EXPERIENCE;  sales people will be all over you to get the sale, BUT once that takes place - that's it!  There is not a representative assigned to you once the sale is done. Which there should be.  You find yourself floundering and asking people that cannot help you because it's not their job and you STILL have questions once the sale is complete.  You will get text messages where they do not even identify themselves - and at the beginning I thought they were scams ( and didn't pay attention to them).  I was assigned a wonderful (again I do not even know her title) sales person, let's call her, who did a great job to help get through the process and the red tape.  I reached out to her many times only because she was the only one to get back to me via phone or text me consistently. The individual that set up my delivery was also wonderful.  So the car gets to me, and as another reviewer stated, much to my surprise there was only ONE key/fob.  Apparently, because there was a picture of the ONE key sitting on a seat of the new car - I was suppose to assume that there was only one key fab?? I don't think so.   It also came with a BIG scratch that I did not see.  I did bring it to an auto body shop friend and he stated it was definitely a new scratch - which leads me to believe that it happened in the delivery process.    Maybe because the car was black and the pictures were not great - of which I asked over again to get better pictures, I therefore, never saw the scratch.  The  Customer Resolution team was of no help at all - NOW if I ever want someone to do business with my company again- I would do everything in my power to keep a positive relationship going.  No one was willing to get a quote for a new FOB (because it's much cheaper for a dealer to get a fob than a customer), to get me another key or even research the scratch.  It's called disclosure- no one along the way disclosed either of these things to me.  Watch the FINE print I guess.  That was an easy fix. Well, that was my experience,.  I love, love, love the car.

So my experience buying a car was a bit of a rollercoaster ride. I'm going to give an honest review here.First,  on Monday May 6th I placed a $500 deposit on a 2020 Ford Escape and was then told it had already been sold. I've seen that echoed in other reviews. Jennifer told me the dealerships are in charge of updating inventory and don't always remove sold cars quickly. I was told I can get the deposit refunded or transferred over to another car if I had seen others. Jennifer helped recommend a few similar cars and I chose a Jeep Compass with low mileage. On May 7 Jennifer said she'd let me know as soon as the vehicle was secured. May 8 I didn't hear anything back.May 9th Jennifer let me know she was out of office and the vehicle was secured but it wasn't marked as such in the system. She told me \"contracting\" should be reaching out soon.May 9th and Heather reached out to me and let me know that due to my state I'd have to sign documents in person in front of a notary. Some states allow you to sign everything online so this step could be done in one day, but she wasn't able to get the papers out until Friday so I didn't receive them until Monday evening. The notary was closed so I went on Tuesday, but had to return the car I was borrowing so was able to send the papers back on Wednesday. Heather received them on Thursday, so this step of the process took an entire week for me. During this time I paid the dealership. May 17th and I was told the delivery coordinator should reach out to me via email or text.I heard nothing until Sunday, May 19th I got a call from the delivery driver that he was arriving that day. Good thing I wasn't out of town. After that, I got a text fom Patrece that the car would arrive the next day. I told Patrece I just got a call from the driver that he was arriving today. She was surprised but it didn't surprise me since communication between departments seemed to be lacking. The delivery guy delivered my car and the rear panel that holds the 3rd brake light had been stripped off and there were 2 dents in the front windshield. I forwarded photos of this to Patrece and she told me a member of their team would be reaching out to investigate.May 20th Lidia with the Customer Satisfaction team reached out and I sent her the pictures. First, I got no response in a day and I was told she was out. Once she was back she was great in helping me find the part and schedule to replace it with a local mechanic. She also scheduled a Safelight appointment to fix the chips. They sent a check to cover these costs since apparently the car was not sent in that condition. No idea what happened to that rear panel that's strange to me. TL;DR:I think the experience received with Driveway is heavily affected by a) lack of communication between departments, b) if your customer service rep in any department is out you won't be advised, you just won't hear from anyone until they return c) the state you buy your car and the state you live  can affect how long things takeOverall, it was an interesting experience to buy a car online.

Driveway did something that no other lender could, providing financing for a vehicle I really wanted without requiring an astronomical down-payment to secure it.  Even the interest rate is marginally better than what I was being offered elsewhere.  This was a HUGE win, and one of the primary reasons I would engage Driveway again should a need ever arise.Next (and this one should be taken with a modicum of a factor of luck with regards to who is going to be your \"concierge\" in the process), communication with certain parties was on par with excellent - specifically, Lily.  Rarely did she leave me wanting for a response longer than 10-15 minutes so long as she was in the office.  However, as notated later, this was grossly inconsistent.Finally, paperwork is overnighted once everything is ready for contracting, and they provide a prepaid return overnight envelope.  Nothing out-of-pocket was spent getting documents with original signatures where they needed to go.Now the not-so-good.First, as mentioned above, communication is severely lacking from key individuals, such as Nathan (the person responsible for releasing your vehicle for delivery) and the other person responsible for actually arranging delivery.  I texted many, many, many times to multiple people to try to find out what was going on with delivery of my vehicle, and Nathan flat-out refuses to reply, while others promise they're looking into it when the reality is, they are doing no such thing.  Things got so out of hand that at one point I requested cancelation of my deal, but after a few hours of cooling off (needed after I was getting nothing but the runaround with regards to the actual upcoming delivery date), I went ahead and took delivery.You will be told that the process can take as few as ten days, but as many as 21 - REPEATEDLY.  This is not reassuring when there is this much money involved in a transaction.  My vehicle was only located a couple of states away, yet was picked up from the dealership on a Wednesday and not delivered until Saturday (which was still a couple days sooner than the SECOND updated delivery date I received which was going to be the following Monday).At many points in the process, I had to reach out to the actual dealership independent of Driveway staff to find out what was going on.  You will not be given direct contact information for some of the instrumental staff involved in getting your deal going, which is extremely frustrating.  It also bears mentioning that there is damage to my car that was not documented in the photos provided either by the dealership or by Driveway (I'm assuming Driveway just uses the dealer photos and modifies them for their platform), which was REALLY annoying to take delivery of a vehicle with an unexpected bash and scratches.  But, since I signed documents sight-unseen stating I'm accepting the vehicle as-is, I have absolutely no recourse in this matter.Overall, I would do this again, again all the while knowing I'd be rolling the dice with the level of communication from various Driveway staff, the actual condition of the vehicle itself, and the utter crap-show that actual delivery of my vehicle turned out to be.", "rating": 3}, {"title": "I\u2019m dissatisfied with Driveway delay in\u2026", "text": "I\u2019m dissatisfied with Driveway delay in paying lien holder.", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Anything but \"easy\"", "text": "After an excellent initial experience with Broderick, I had multiple negative experiences with this company that claims to \"make the journey easy.\" I purchased a vehicle that had to be delivered from CA. I was told some paperwork could be done digitally, some had to be hard copy, and a few would need to be notarized. The documents they sent contained multiple errors that required they be redone and sent back to me more than once - including after I'd already taken time off to get some notarized. After finally getting the correct forms and returning them, I was repeatedly told I would get updates on delivery. I was told when it arrived at a Driveway facility in my state to be cleaned and prepped. Several days went by with no updates or information unless I asked. Then suddenly I was told it was literally en route to me and about 1.5 hrs away. All told it took close to 4 weeks.Once I got the vehicle, there were no temporary plates and no title, even though I'd paid in full. I had to reach out to multiple people at Driveway before I was told they were going to register and get permanent plates for me so they needed the title temporarily. That's understandable - but why not tell me ahead of time? More importantly, with no temp plates, I could not drive the vehicle. I was told I could get temporary plates from my state DMV by more than 1 person at Driveway. Again, if you're trying to \"make the journey easy\" why wasn't this communicated to me ahead of time? In this case, that's because what I was told is not true. After I got through to the DMV, I learned this is not something the DMV does in my state. More attempts to get help from Driveway and I finally spoke with 1 person who knew that my state DMV does not do that. Their solution? They told me to buy a 3-day travel permit and then renew it every 3 days over the 2-3 weeks she said it would take to get permanent plates. In short, I was told to do something illegal so that I did not own a vehicle that I could not drive. Again, why was none of this explained to me ahead of time?Finally, the vehicle itself had a few issues: headlight out, broken latch on a cupholder, and it only came with 1 key (with an almost dead battery.) I raised these issues with one person at Driveway who told me not to worry and that Driveway would help. However, when I brought them up with the Customer Resolution person, I was told \"things do break.\" She was full of excuses but short on empathy and \"resolution\" - I was basically told I would need to take care of fixing the issues that the vehicle arrived with. I did not pay for a \"broken\" vehicle! At the very least show some concern and offer to find a dealership to repair it. As far as the missing key, I was told that because the photos of the car didn't show 2 keys, they don't provide 2 keys??? Vehicles are sold with 2 keys. That is standard and if that is not the case - once again - communicate it clearly! (There was nothing written anywhere about not providing 2) Again, no resolution or even attempt at understanding - basically just \"too bad.\"In short, a company that claims to \"make the journey easy\" was anything but. I have bought a lot of vehicles over the years, and this was the most difficult and unsatisfactory car buying experience I've ever had.9.25.23: Sarah and I had a very productive and helpful discussion on Friday and now we have a good plan to address my concerns. I will update this further as we go along. I do appreciate Sarah making additional effort to resolve this.", "rating": 3}, {"title": "The management was helpful ", "text": "Driveway is not for everyone.", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Recommend over in-person dealerships, but with caveats", "text": "I'm giving 3 stars, but I'd rather give a 7 out of 10 if it was an option. The buying experience had quite a few positives, but it's not a perfect experience. In my case there were a few issues I can't ignore, most of which were later in the process. Skip to the end for the TL;DR summary.The car I received was in great condition, clean and pristine. Financing was convenient and there were absolutely no hidden fees. Given the state of dealerships these days this should never be taken for granted. It only took two weeks from the day I ordered my vehicle online to the day I actually took delivery (this is a car that shipped from CA to FL). Any forms and paperwork required I tried to send as soon as I received them, and that probably contributed to the speed of receiving the vehicle. The only complaints I have came after receiving the car.Be warned, if you need a drivable car immediately then buying from out of state isn't the best option. The process of passing paperwork between the respective dealerships and DMVs can propagate some serious delays, delays that Driveway can't do anything about and can leave you without car registration for MONTHS. In my case, I received the car at the very end of June 2023 and registration came in mid September. My state doesn't do temporary tags in this case, so much like the name of the company my car sat in my driveway.While very professional and friendly, Driveway's support staff didn't follow up with me that often. With any of my inquiries about the registration they promised to follow up, but rarely did so. After signing the paperwork and giving my down payment, communication felt like less of a priority for them, and this is not a unique complaint as I've seen this in other reviews. Worse yet, when I received my registration it only lasted 3 months, expiring in December even though the registration fee Driveway collected should at least get 6 months.After much back and forth, Driveway support left me with more promises to follow up that were often unkept. Even when I followed up and contacted them, they pawned it off on \"the DMV team\" or \"looking up the case notes\" and the cycle repeats. This is probably the biggest criticism I have (as do other reviewers), but I would still recommend Driveway over in-person dealerships if I had to choose. I'd take phone tag over sneaky fees and high pressure sales tactics, but that's just my preference.And finally, I have a few suggestions for Driveway. All of the major pizza chains have a \"pizza tracker,\" a webpage/screen customers can visit to see the status of their order, from \"order received\" to \"in the oven\" to \"final inspection\" and then delivery. If this can be done with pizza, why not cars? Having more transparency would ease a lot of customer concerns. Driveway's customer service team already takes internal notes for each case/order, why not just create a pin/password secured page where customers can view the notes related to their car and registration process, as well as a progress bar? This would solve MANY of the complaints I've seen, including my own. No need to call support for updates = more time for support staff to handle other matters. But also, please have some accountability measures for support staff to actually follow up with customers. Lastly, my car was an EV. For electric vehicles, total mileage is less important to judging condition than battery condition. It would be incredibly useful to know how much range is left on the high voltage battery if it is a used vehicle.Overall, I'm happy with the vehicle I received, as well as the financing and price transparency. The experience was better in many ways than the alternative of going to different dealerships in-person. The worst of the buying experience came down to registration delays/issues and the lack of responsiveness from customer support. Improving customer service responsiveness and building customer portal for order status would make this a sharply competitive car buy option.", "rating": 3}, {"title": "Registration and Temp Tags!!!!!", "text": "UPDATE 01/11/24: Since my initial review, I finally got an email stating I will have my plates tomorrow. I was also provided a tracking number. Driveway was also nice enough to issue a check for half of my upcoming car note for the inconvenience. Driveway actually wasn\u2019t the cause of the delay in me receiving my plates, it my DMV office. They are behind on paperwork due to the holiday\u2019s. So all in all beside this mishap, it was a good experience from the start. My only issue was me receiving my plates and being unable to drive my vehicle for a month. Which again I just found out it was due to my state DMV and NOT Driveway.Previous Review:The process of picking a car, putting money down and picking up the vehicle was a good process. I picked up my vehicle on November 4th. The dealership placed a 30 day temp tag on my car, handed over the keys and I was on my way back home to CT. Keep in mind the car was picked up from a dealership in NJ. I was reimbursed the delivery fee because there was no delivery that took place. The check came fairly quick. At this point I was thinking compared to others, everything is going so smooth. What can possibly go wrong? Well, I received an email on Tuesday, November 7th stating I have to complete a VIN verification for my vehicle in order to complete registration for the car. I went out at that exact minute to have it done because I didn\u2019t want to delay anything. As soon as the VIN checked out, I overnight the form back to Driveway as they requested. I then receive an email on Wednesday, November 15, 2024 confirming that my paperwork was sent to a local dmv and is currently processing. Here is where I start to get worried. Knowing my plates expire 12/03 and NJ legally can only issue one temp plate. But I gave it time and hoped the plates will get here before then. It is now 12/04 and I don\u2019t have no PLATES. I make my 1st car note on the 14th and is unable to drive my vehicle to get back and forth. This is unacceptable. When I spoke with customer service they said it will take another 2-3 weeks for it to come. They offered to pay 1/2 my car note off. Which I wasn\u2019t oppose to at first, until they threw in if I agree to them paying 1/2 the car note it\u2019s authorizing that I will release them from all future claims regarding this issue. I disagreed to the terms, as what if it takes longer then I won\u2019t be able to hold them accountable. I even asked if they can give me the registration paperwork so I can bring to the DMV, they said no. I called my state DMV to see about issuing temp tag and they said they can\u2019t do anything without paperwork for my vehicle. SMH!!!!Spoke with another representative on 12/06 to get and ETA or update on the status my plates. No updates. She stated I should expect my plates with it being the holiday season no later than 12/29. That will mean it almost being close to a month that I won\u2019t be able to drive my car. I asked was there any alternatives. She said no, pretty much they did all they can do on their end and a message was sent to their registration department to see if they can expedite everything. In all my years I never had to wait this long for plates. Now I\u2019m paying on a vehicle I can\u2019t drive and based off previous reviews no telling when I will receive them. I called my state DMV and they have nothing in their system when I provided them with my VIN for my vehicle. SMH.

Received it the next day after notifying them that the car arrived without tags. The temp tag expired Nov 10. I had started calling Driveway everyday from October 26 to please hurry up with the dmv paperwork. I learned on November 8th, 2 days before the temp tag expiration date, they finally sent the paperwork and the expected time is 5-6 weeks. That's ~1.5 months. I called them to send me a new temp tag so I can continue driving but they said they can't and told me to goto local dmv and try and get one. They sent me a scanned copies of all the files sent to the dmv and suggested I request a temp tag with those files as a proof. I went to the local dmv and requested if I can have a temp plate but I need to have the dmv paperwork under processing state to obtain a temp tag and no, you need original documents. They were willing to complete the process right there if I had the original documents. I told the dmv that the paperwork has been sent to dmv by Driveway but dmv checked my name and license number but found nothing. I told them that Driveway claims dmv is backed up and could take a long time to process the dmv paperwork. The Dmv supervisor literally called out bunch of people, \"Could you raise your hand if you're here for vehicle registration and title transfer?\".  5-6 people raised their hand. That was embarrassing. I called Driveway 3 days daily after tag expiration to ask where did they send my dmv paperwork or if they have any updates. They said, they don't know and will find out and call me back. I also asked them if they have a tracking number or application filed number for my dmv paperwork which I could show to dmv. They gave me a ups tracking number -  1ZY308V10194402155.

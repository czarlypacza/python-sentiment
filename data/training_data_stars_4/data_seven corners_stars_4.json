After one month vacation, I started to feel pain in my right ear, which is not normal for me. So, after 3 days and still feeling the same pain I went to an Immediate Clinic to rule out infection, after making sure I chose a clinic within the policy PPO network,. To do so, I checked out clinics on their webpage and also called Seven Corners Assistance to confirm, and by going to this clinic I didn't have to file a claim later myself (it was automatic), and they ended up paying most of the claim. I believe the insurance company and the clinic agreed on a value to close the claim. So far, I only paied the co-pay amount for that doctor's visit, which was 20$ in accordance to policy regulations. I was pleased with that, things went well and I didn't have an infection - just inflamation...!The only thing I didn't like with this whole experience was the fact that I received the very day before my trip an e-mail from Seven Corners with some quick links to access (Emergency Assistance, Common Questions, File a Claim), and I was surprised to find that none of them worked! This was unsettling as it happened just before my trip. I e-mail them back with this complain and they never answered, which was completely unprofessional.Also, the APP doesn't work in USA territory.To sum up on a positive note, they were quick to resolve the claim, paid the amount, helped me when I called them to address my questions.

My representative was extremely helpful, and stated that I needed to select \u2018no\u2019 when asked if your trip includes the United States as a destination, which I also found to be confusing since I live in the U.S. and will be flying back here on my return trip. The website needs to give an explanation as to what that statement (which is mandatory in order to get a quote) means.

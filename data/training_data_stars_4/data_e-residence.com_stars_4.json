I had a very tight deadlines and wrote address without questions and said I need it ASAP. On that they replied, they understood. They didn't sent me a tracking number until I asked them. It's not okay to take extra 100 euro for express delivery and not tell you anything! However, they did the job and delivered it quick.

I searched for other services and after a couple of days found some. only when I asked for some information for the other service I was told that e residence has a translation service as well. I accepted the offer with the information that it would take 7 days. I canceled the other service. Then it took 7 days longer means two weeks for the translation!

For a little over \u00a3150 GBP I obtained an NIE from my desk ! Even better, their promised 6 weeks turned into 10 days !  This won't suit many people as you can get an NIE much cheaper if you're already in Spain or live near a Spanish Consulate elsewhere in the world. For my own reasons it suited me to use this very convenient service. Two things to be aware of... they don't tell you in advance that you need a pdf of your whole passport ( luckily I have a friend with the right software ) and also the application requires a Spanish address. ( again, luckily I had a work-around) You only find this out once you've paid & are going through the application. So a little more transparency would be good.  This is why they're not a 5 star in my opinion. Otherwise, happy to recommend.

The staff was very thorough, polite and responsive. We didn't pay for expedited service but we got the NIF in just a couple days via email. We paid extra to have the NIF certificates sent to us but that took many weeks and much longer than expected for them to send the certificates to us. The e-residence part of the opening a bank account was took about a month and right on e-residence's schedule. However, the contact at the bank has been very slow to respond to our communications and not what we expected. The bank contact has advised that the account is blocked for about 2 more months after opening while the bank does their due diligence. This is out of e-residence's control but their web site gave no indication of the two month block and the poor support from the bank contact.

Here are a few things you should know ahead of time:- don't order the 50 euro delivery of your NIF if you plan on printing it out on a computer. I assumed the mailed version would be a formalized version of the NIF. It's not. It's been printed, put in an envelope, and sent to you for 50 euros. It is exactly what you would print out if they emailed it to you. - I gave myself the 10 day NIF option and it arrived in 24 hours (after my initial issues were solved), not sure if you really need the faster option. Good news though, it came super fast!- The chat help service option is actually a WhatsApp phone number that can take up to 12 hours to respond, so don't count on a quick chat response if you have any pressing questions. - You do need to use biometrics to verify your identity to acquire your NIF. This isn't explained prior to purchase, only after you purchase. It requires some photo matching and identification, but didn't ask for any further biometrics. It's a third party biometrics company and seemed safe and secure.", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Easy to use but what about security?", "text": "It feels very risky to submit all of my identification and digital signature to an online portal.

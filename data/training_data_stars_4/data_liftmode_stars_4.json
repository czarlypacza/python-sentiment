I just got an assortment of the samples they\u2019re running and based off what I got will definitely be back for more. The Baicalm and Mood Lift capsules are a must try for those looking for energy, nootropic/neuroprotective, mood boosting and sleep enhancing solutions effects.The MT-55 extract of Kanna and its mote potently extracted form are great mood boosters. Just watch out if your sensitive to stimulants or are on serotonergics because kanna effects your serotonin levels. Overall: 8/10 = 4/5 hence the 4 stars. I would love to give 5 stars but I try to be realistic. I got the baicalm sample, mood lift sample, sleep support sample, kanna mt-55 and \u201ckanna gum\u201d samples and a small jar of the more stimulating, potent version. So far I\u2019ve tried it all but the gum and they all work.The kanna isn\u2019t as stimulating as I thought but definitely brings the mood boost and an almost calming effect.The more potent version, however. Did give noticeable stimulation. This was after dosing mood lift and 15mg of mt55 in the morning so tolerance may have dulled the stimulation. Still worked well as a mood booster. Basicalm and the sleep capsules did their job amazingly.Can\u2019t wait to try some gum at work today.

It's good if you have little insomnia here and there, but not for serious insomnia. But good when combined with other sleep supplements like Valerian Root. Phenethylamine: Great stimulant, but very short-acting (1 to 2 hours) I would suggest combining it with Hordenine to increase the duration which I found works nicely. Be aware though the crash aka after the effects wear out is not comfortable so use these compounds sparingly. Sleep Caps: Didn't work that good for me, but it works really well for my brother, so worth a try if you suffer from insomnia.

This costs more, and it's a d*ck thing to do to loyal/hooked customers, even if it's an attempt to stay off DEA scheduling radar, which I suspect it is.Having people show up at the ER from withdrawel is far worse than openly selling half kilos of a Russian pharm on the clearnet. As a Gaba B agonist, it's withdrawel symptoms and risk are on par with others - GHB, Alcohol, barbiturates...this means they're very bad. Agonizing nentally and physically. Tremors delusion, siezures, extreme anxiety, insomnia (extended inability to sleep compounding all of the above), and no ER will accept you for detox if you show up saying your kicking phen. They've either not heard of it or their system is too full with opiate addicts....but they do keep a log and report to the government and this would be the evidence the DEA holds up to get the Banhammer out.The DEA and FDA a despise substances that people use to self medicate, especially sucMy point is this - you're screwing your customers and yourselves by making a product you laid out unaffordable for some. I would bet 70% if not way more of your profit comes from phenibut. Stop price gauging now that you cornered the market. Buy out Newmind or something and spread your sales out or. Don't telling your customers it's a stocking issue when your competition is selling at the best prices they've ever listed, because some of us see what's going on and will buy from them just to screw you back (look up my sales record as an example). I'm fortunate enough to have a doctor that will write a baflofen prescription having never heard of it, but most are not. Some are finding themselves in situations where it's lose your job or go to the ER and try to explain what phenibut is and why they've been consuming it by the gram not the MG...Still the best in the supplement game.

That said, every once in a while, I might receive an order that doesn't quite seem to be at the caliber of the others I routinely purchase, but it's more than acceptable. And I'm sure I could reach out to LiftMode and say something, but the difference in quality is so minute that it's not even close to worth it.A recent trend that I've found a bit disappointing is slowly increasing costs on some of their products. The price of 1000 mg worth of Phenibut fluctuates on the site (I assume this depends on stock availability), but recently those fluctuations have tended to push prices higher and higher. What I might have paid for around $160 or so a few months ago can now cost $220 or more. I've also noticed that the range of products available fluctuates from time to time. For example, I prefer to purchase Phenibut that's in a large or medium crystal grain size, but lately, only the fine crystal or powder versions are in stock. The mobile site could also use some work, as the menu options at the top no longer appear with labels. I know from the past to press the orange buttons at the top to pull down options to select but always have to press a few of them before locating the link that I need. Or, when using the search feature for products (for instance, entering the term \"Phenibut\" to search), not all quantities of Phenibut appear in the search, making it seem as though the larger bottles are not for sale. The only way to locate the larger quantities is to go into my previous orders and click \"reorder\" -- which puts whatever larger size bottle that might be in stock into my cart.  They do offer discounts for longtime customers, but I wish these were more substantial, especially as the prices have trended upward.

But a customer should know, for instance, that if they take, say, six spoonfuls of Phenibut every day for two weeks and then stop, they very well might experience a mini psychotic episode. This could easily confuse a person into thinking they've gone crazy. So, I think some sort of very clear acknowledgement by Liftmode, of the many effects of these supplements will go a long way toward the integrity and service of the company. A little hand-holding, sensitively written, will help a user understand the complexities of some supplements, and that the products will not hurt them. That said, I believe the supplememnts benefit and can, ljterally, safe lives. \rThank you.", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Phenibut", "text": "So far so good.

This did not happen and the result was that my insurance was suspended, my insurance lapsed, then the payment was schedule for December 2022 rather than December 2021. I noticed this immediately, but it took intervention from Brendan to get the issue resolved and my closing was delayed for several weeks. A big thank you to Brendan for his proactive involvement!!I also have a recommendation for the future. The main reason I took out equity in the refinance was too eliminate credit card debt. Checks I received to pay creditors were made out to the creditor names listed in my credit reports, not the actual payee information in my monthly statements. All payments are now successfully completed, but two payments took longer to clear than the others. I mailed all payments on the same day, all had payment coupons with them, and several went to the same city/state. I do realize that some creditors are slower to process than others, but I can't help but think that having the payee name be exactly correct would help. My recommendation is that part of the process include getting correct payee information.Closing signing was excellent and the documents I signed were well explained.My overall rating is 5 stars to Brendan and 4 stars to the process.", "rating": 4}, {"title": "My wife and I contacted NewDay12/8/2021\u2026", "text": "My wife and I contacted NewDay12/8/2021 and we closed on 3/12/2022. A representative reached out to us on 12/9/2021.  Our main purposes of the refi was to obtain a lower interest rate, eliminate the mortgage insurance cost and capitalize on the equity in our home.  Shortly after the initial application and document collection process we locked in a interest rate slightly higher than our original loan but acceptable.  On12/9/2021 I was then asked to provide my divorce decree from 30 years ago.  I complied but then I was asked to provide every document including court orders from that divorce. I thought this was rather odd as I've never been asked this before for any other mortgages before.  However, I contacted the Delaware Court on 1/12/2022,  I finally received and provided 87 pages to our representative. (Roughly a 30 day delay in processing).  Our date of interest rate lock again had passed and consequently our interest rates rose again.  We completed both an appraisal and Wood Destroying Insect inspection/report.  I tried several times in as many days to contact our representative by phone leaving voice mails and by email but to no avail.  On or about 2/25/2022 a new representative contacted me and got things moving forward once again.  Because of the new representatives outstanding hard work and customer service he pulled things together and achieved closure therefore, I rated 4 stars.   I can't help but feel if James OConner was our representative at the begging of our quest the final interest rate would be lower, closing would have been sooner and I would rated it 5 stars.Thank you for all you do and giving me this opportunity comment.", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Service was excellent thanks to all who\u2026", "text": "Service was excellent thanks to all who helped.", "rating": 4}, {"title": "It was harder than it needed to be!", "text": "We started our application with New Day In the second week of January. We had a very nice representative helping us. We provided all documentation that was requested and were told we would qualify for a loan . The next week was signing all the required paperwork and checking credit reports. During this time we were in contact with our assigned account person who once again told us things were moving forward and we would have a closing date in February. We were very excited and started to make plans for some needed home improvement projects. Two days before the closing date we get a call stating our loan was denied based on a vague credit report that was over 5 years old. Needless to say we were totally caught off guard and so disappointed. We were not given any other options at that time.My husband is a veteran of the Viet Nam war and felt New Day understood veterans and their issues better than any other lending agency so we were totally at a loss. The following day we got a call from Kris who wanted to know how we were doing. We were quite surprised! I let him know how disappointing the denial decision was and proceeded to tell us that their finance team wanted to take another look at our file if we would agree . We said yes and the process started all over again. This time I felt that Kris and his team were really looking out for our best interest. The policies and procedures of New Day differ greatly from most other lending agencies and that caused a few anxious moments but we worked through them with The help and guidance of Kris and his team. We closed our loan last week and received our check after the 3 day waiting period. I would suggest direct deposit to make it easier on your customers. Over all we were very pleased with  the second application process . Kris was a joy to work with and made us feel comfortable and important.

Primary reason is that I need to start building equity in my home. Secondary reason is that I have experienced a few issues in the processing of the last two.Positive comments:Joe Delgado, my Account Executive, did a good job.  Generally, he was timely in his responses and kept me informed on the status of my loan application.  I realize my account was probably not the only one he was assigned. He answered all of my questions, even if I didn't always like the answer. I am satisfied with my monthly mortgage payment, this time.  Being able to bundle my personal and auto loan payments, will help me tremendously. My previous refinance had an issue (loan estimate did not include my Windstorm and Hail Policy in my estimated monthly escrow payment) that I was able to identify during the application process. Adding the cost of this policy resulted in a higher monthly mortgage payment.  This was an issue for me as I was under the impression that a lower monthly payment was New Day's primary marketing point to veterans. Negative Comments:During the application process, from the first phone call to the last phone call on 3 Jan, I had been told that I would receive a significant cash payment at closing.  During the first phone call from Joe, I believe I was told something to the effect that based on my finances I may receive as much as $20K. The exact statement(s) can be confirmed in your recorded phone calls with me.  My 2 Dec Loan Estimate showed a reduced cash payment amount of $11,846 but still significant to me nonetheless. I didn't retain copies of the other loan estimates I reviewed but believe they too showed me still receiving a cash payment at closing. I can't recall the actual amount but believe it was $3K - $4K. On 3 Jan, Joe contacted me that the cash payment at closing was being completely eliminated.  And while I somewhat understand the rationale used by your management team, my expectations had wrongfully been raised since the initial phone call with the proverbial rug being pulled out from underneath me. While I realistically never believed the $20K cash payment would ever happen, follow on discussions with Joe continued leaving me with the impression that I would still receive something. That was until Joe called me on 3 Jan and told me no cash payment would be paid at closing. As I told Joe, I would have preferred that a cash payment not even be mentioned until a complete and more accurate assessment of my finances could have been done. I have no reason to believe that the management team was not doing everything possible to make the numbers work but I don't feel real good about how this ended.", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Good service.", "text": "Date of experience: May 11, 2022", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Quick and perfect", "text": "Date of experience: November 30, 2021", "rating": 4}, {"title": "Burkett loan review", "text": "Steve Murphy and Tyler Nolan were super easy to with with.

NewDay USA did the absolute best job of clearly presenting what they were offering. However, their marketing approach is where I downgraded them from five to four stars. I have a hearing impairment and I avoid phone calls. I requested information from NewDay on their web site explaining my hearing problem and asked for more information by email instead of phone. I received a response by PHONE and email within 24 hours. I did not answer the phone call and by e-mail again explained my hearing problem. I got no response. This happened twice. Finally, the third different account executive (AE) agreed to proceed by email and from that point forward the process went smoothly. I can only assume that some NewDay AEs do not know how to type. After I had begun the refi process with them, NewDay continued to bombard me with mailings and phone calls. I can understand the mailings due to the latency of the USPS. However, I must have received over ten phone solicitations from NewDay AFTER I had agreed to refi with them. I knew it was NewDay because the callers left voice mail messages. They need a better tracking system to call off the hounds!!! Once I was connected with the AE who handled my refi, the qualification and paperwork phase was outstanding! My AE honored my request to work primarily through email. She gave me frequent updates throughout the process and patiently answered all of my questions. The closing was painless. NewDay scheduled a closing notary to come to our house and she arrived on-time and was very competent. The closing took one hour to complete. My initial contact with the AE who handled my refi was on Jan 5. The closing occurred on Jan 20 and I confirmed my old mortgage was paid off on Jan 25. I cannot comment yet on the follow-through. Although I have received notification that my previous mortgage has been paid off, I have not yet received instructions for beginning payments on the new loan. This is not a criticism since I realize the first payment due date is over 30 days away. Overall, the entire refi process with NewDay was highly efficient and painless (with minor irritations of consistent marketing phone calls.)

You lose all credibility when you stumble reading a script. On closing day, I had a question on a Florida requirement. I called, and emailed. The only voice i could connect to was voicemail.

This resulted in delays that caused the loan process to be extended and not meet the stated refinance closing date. It was delayed almost one month from the original date that was stated. Also, I submitted a voided check at my final closing and was told I would receive a wired deposit to my bank account. Instead I received a check which had to be cleared by my bank resulting in an additional delay of over a week before funds were available. I understand wire transfers cost money but when the customers are told they will receive a wire transfer they should receive one, not a check.

I also really love that there is no fly or anything in the front and they have a band inside for extra \u201csmoothing\u201d of the tummy area. I just wish this band was a bit wider/larger and extended a bit lower to make for a more seamless and smooth look in front. The sizes were a bit hard for me to figure out since I wear a 6-8. The sizes are 4-6 and 8-10. I got the larger size and the are great but a bit big. So next time I\u2019ll be getting the smaller size which should work since they are so stretchy and soft. My advice if you are in between sizes like me is to get the smaller one because of the stretchy nature of the material. I think the waist band will work better too in a smaller size. I messed up when ordering and got the regular length instead of the petite and they are a bit long, but with a pair of higher shoes they are wonderful! Definitely recommend.

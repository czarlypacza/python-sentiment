My initial contact, Khalil Robinson,  was the BEST! He politely checked in with me frequently to see if I'd found the right home yet, & he was never pushy. Right to the finale, 3 month's later, he tailored the loan I could afford, was pleasant & extremely understanding. Talking me off the ledge numerous times. I'm a widowed senior, confident yet careful, with a Fixed income. He gave me hope that we could make this new dream come true, & We Did! What an exemplary employee,  all around very nice young man, \ud83d\udc4f & I tear up thinking about him. I can be a challenge & he took it in stride, assuring me we'd make this happen, & We Did. Thanks again, Khalil. I'm forever Grateful & wish you an abundant Life, full of great times & robust health.Cynthia D, Momma & Buster\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc95\ud83e\udec2", "rating": 5}, {"title": "The professional staff made everything easy.", "text": "The whole process was easy because everything was explained clearly and completely from the beginning.

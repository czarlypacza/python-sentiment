Everything moved quickly and took only about 5-6 business days.Jake and Corey from the Dallas Hub came to pick up my car, and I was paid on the spot via Real Time Payment, which was super convenient.

I would definitely recommend my family and friends to Driveway.This is how it works, Driveway send out both the online electronic Docusign through email and physical paperwork overnight to you with instruction where to sign it. You sign both the electronic and physical paperwork and postmark the physical paperwork within 3 days in the provided UPS envelop.  Once Driveway receive and process the paperwork, the car would be scheduled for pickup depending on where you live. Driveway then send a U.S bank link over email for you to fill in your banking information. Keep in mind, when the car is picked up onto the transport trailer, just snap a photo and send it to Driveway dispatch team. Call dispatch team for confirmation and the fund would be release to your banking account. That's it.",

Dane was truly outstanding and answered a million questions on my part. There was a few issues with the car upon receipt that I was not aware of. Dane took it upon himself to reach out and get these small issues resolved and really went to bat for me and made me feel really great about the choice I made which made me happy with my purchase even though I had a seven day return window.

It arrived in PERFECT condition and is the most beautiful car I have ever owned. Honestly, I much prefer buying a car this way and probably won't go back to buying locally. Their inventory is just too large to ignore, it's all in great condition, and the process is fast and easy. It takes a bit longer than buying locally but for me it's worth it.

I'm ASTOUNDED that ANYONE would agree to such terms. At that point, if Driveway.com finds or INVENTS fault or changes their mind, they can pay whatever they'd like, and seller would have to resort to litigation to get redress? They aren't kidding when they say possession is 9/10s of the law. I told them to kick rocks, think you should too.UPDATE:After the initial review (above) I was contacted by their head of operations. He confirmed the policies, but assured me that he could verify that my bank participated in their Immediate Payment system, which in fact they did. Still wasn't thrilled about having to sign and ship documents prior to getting funds, but agreed to try.  But turns out it went like clock work. Dealer rep showed up on schedule to pick up the car, and when I asked about funds transfer, he said he had no idea since he wasn't with Driveway So I told him no go until I contact Driveway, which I did. The rep there spoke to the dealer's driver to confirm pickup, and IMMEDIATELY initiated payment. The funds hit my account before the vehicle left my driveway (no pun intended). Driveway went the extra mile to make the deal, and earned my trust. Can't speak to buying, but selling to them turned out to be easy and reliable, and they made BY FAR the most reasonable offer.

This was a first car purchase for our son who needs to follow step by step what is needed. Their process allows that. So much better than sitting in front of a finance person who shoves papers and a whole lot of double talk at you. Our issue was NOT with Driveway.com but with the dealership (of course). The dealership paperwork did not match the proposal we signed with Driveway.com and we didn't realize it until later in the day. Ryan went above and beyond his job responsibilities to work with contracts and the dealership to get this right. We did get a refund of the difference from the dealership. Patrik from Driveway reached out to us during this time based on our initial review and between him and Ryan they provided stellar customer service. Thank goodness because the dealership was not helpful nor responsive. I would definitely use Driveway.com again just to avoid dealing with a dealership ever again! Not much has changed with the dealership business model since I bought my first car 40 years ago! ",

However, saw that it was also posted in driveway. I reached out to the team at driveway and they explained to me that they\u2019re able to allocate the vehicle since their inventory comes from an actual dealership. Which sells new and used. Being that the vehicle is a used as is vehicle I decided to try it out, knowing I had the flexibility of returning the vehicle if  it wasn\u2019t as expected. I picked up the vehicle once it was verified that it was still available, and made my deposit. Once at the dealership everything was a breeze. Did a pre purchase inspection and everything checked out.Pros- The team agents of driveway are quick to response back to your inquiry.-provide detail information of the vehicle.-Dealer allocated cars.Con-There might be a time zone difference depending what agent you reach out to.",

I received it 3-4 days later.Received my car and the rear differential is trash and the gas tank door is stuck. Spoke with service department & was told it's under 60 day warranty.Took a week for approval to do repairs! My car has been at the dealership for 2 weeks now & still no update on when the parts will arrived! I\u2019m here to express my appreciation for Driveway. Although, it started off rocky they definitely finished STRONG! Sarah is truly AMAZING! I know now, that Driveway wasn\u2019t the problem. I just needed to speak with the right person! Driveway honored their 60 day warranty and even went above the warranty to assist me for my troubles. I\u2019m truly grateful. I will definitely recommend using Driveway for your car needs!

I am a single woman and I live alone, so I did not like the thought of having strangers come to my home to look at my vehicle. I did not need it as a trade-in. I chose Driveway based on reviews and the fact it is located in Oregon. We had a few hiccups, mostly because I live in a rural area and mail service is not always dependable. Overall it was a pretty easy experience and the support staff was always helpful. I would do it again.",

Car broke down, was very stressed about getting a new car as finances have been tight. Did some research and found Driveway. I got prequalified in less than 10 minutes. Then got approved for multiple vehicles for $500 down and decent monthly car payments. Every step of the process was super streamlined and so easy that I thought there had to be some type of catch. Spoke with agents through the whole process. They were super communicative, punctual and friendly. Even ended up having casual conversation with them. Felt like I was talking to real people who actually cared about their job. Best customer service ever. I just got my car delivered today, an 2022 Kia Soul and everything is perfect. My experience with Driveway legitimately made a tough time so much better. Shout out to Cheyenne and Amanda for all the help. Will definitely be recommending Driveway to people!",

She is very thorough with regards to the process and did not give me any unrealistic expectations. Cheyenne was also super quick in getting my car delivered to me. Kasandra from the post - delivery customer satisfaction department helped in getting minor issues fixed and did so very quickly. Thank you all at Driveway.com.

        "text": "I\u2019m going to be honest\u2026It was a little nerve-wracking buying a car on the internet, where I basically have no chance to test drive it before making the purchase and where I must rely on the car being delivered to me. It seems like so much can go wrong, right? But I checked out driveway.com despite my worries and they had an unbeatable price on just the car I was looking for, and I really appreciated the 7-day grace period to test out the car. To top it off, the estimate for my trade-in was the highest offer I received. So I just took a leap of faith! The salesman (Joshua) I dealt with over the phone and via text was kind and helpful through his end of the process, and the others were helpful and informative as well. But it was Noemi Gamez (Dispatch Coordinator) who provided stellar customer service - she constantly provided me with updates and was very responsive to my texts. There were some delays due to VIN issues, but she was persistent about getting the car to me as soon as she could. She\u2019s the Dispatch Coordinator you want on your side. The driver who delivered my vehicle did it right on time and was also very pleasant. I originally gave driveway.com 4 out of 5 stars just because there\u2019s nearly a different contact for each step of the process, and you might have to wait up to a month to get your car, depending on if there are any administrative hurdles along the way. I first spoke to the salesmen on 6/30, and I received my car on 7/25. Also, when I tried to contact the salesman about my VIN issue (after I signed the paperwork to purchase), I never heard back from him. But now that the deal is done and I\u2019ve had a chance to reflect, the process was relatively smooth. I was given my temporary tags along with the car (I recommend asking for an email copy as well, just in case). I was then sent my permanent license plate and registration stickers a couple of weeks after I received my car!  And again, Noemi was so good to work with. Just remember that you\u2019re not getting your car the same day; you have to be ok with waiting a few weeks to a month for delivery. Just stay on top of status and make sure you know who to contact, depending on what step you are at in the process. All in all, a good experience for me. I\u2019d do it again!",

My truck arrived about a week later and it\u2019s better than what I saw online. I\u2019m beyond happy with my experience. Justin was the best and helped us throughout the process and his patience as we as new online buyers called him about every day and he spoke to us and even followed up with me the day of delivery. We will use driveway in the future for sure. ",

Number three worked with Na\u2019al she also kept in constant contact with me, letting me know what was going on with the vehicle every step of the way. I can\u2019t remember the valet guy who delivered the car and covered everything with me,  he was excellent. Even though the car was unacceptable and had damage, he was professional, return the vehicle and it was promptly repaired and redelivered in the condition it should have been delivered it in the first place. We also have just dealt with a guy name, Nasier on several chips that were on the hood of the vehicle during transport. He requested photos. I just sent them to him and look forward to hearing from him and getting these repaired. The overall experience I would give you 10 stars your employees are outstanding and I hope they are compensated well for going over and beyond taking care of your valued customers. I\u2019m very challenging to deal with and had no issues with them what so ever. Thank you for doing a great job.

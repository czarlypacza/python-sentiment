I bought a ticket back home to the US, and then sent all the receipts and information to Seven Corners, including screenshots of the news headlines about the border closing and all tourist travel being suspended. Nine months later, I still have not received any reimbursement from Seven Corners - the opposite - they closed my case instead!

No one could tell me what - if anything - was missing, only that I should keep re-sending the documents. And then finally they just closed my case. No one responds to my email follow-ups. When I call them, no customer representatives can provide me with any information - I've spoken to different representatives each time, and each one of them said they don't know the people reviewing my case, and there is no way to escalate or contact them. In the end, Seven Corners has wasted my time and money, has\u00a0provided no helpful information, no reimbursement, and no way to escalate.

Response: I shouldn't even be speaking to you because of HIPAA... so just going round and round in ever decreasing circles.

I didn't want to use time and money to start fighting with them, especially since I was afraid that they wouldn't cover even the other expenses as \"revenge\". Also, you will need to ask for a pre-certification two days before certain procedures, which will delay your care. They also charged me a 100-dollar \"deductible\" on my prescriptions, even though the plan says that deductible doesn't apply to prescriptions \u2013 therefore breaking their own rules. They never changed this even though they promised to revisit the claim after I called them. On the other hand, the customer service was rather good and they almost always responded quickly \u2013 except one time when they told me that they'd call me back the next day regarding a bill but they never did.

Seven Corners seemingly offered a great value for what we paid: \u201c100% coverage\u201d regarding several travel-related issues, as well as for any non-refundable costs and cancellations made by our travel agency.Then COVID came along and suddenly, they weren\u2019t so \u201c100% coverage\u201d. In fact, they put great effort into NOT taking any responsibility regarding COVID, based upon the completely hands-off nature they handled the situation in: just look at their webpage entirely devoted to COVID-related travel issues outlining what they\u2019re NOT responsible for! Obviously, no one knew COVID was going to happen back in 2019, but they acted as if they wrote it specifically into their stipulations from the beginning, and it\u2019s likely in reference to some vague, jargon-filled clause that nobody knew about (certainly, we didn\u2019t), used as an all-encompassing means to not cover any non-refundable costs and penalties due to situations like COVID. Honestly, what this COVID situation did to disrupt our travel plans was stressful enough to deal with; having their \u201ccoverage\u201d not help out with any COVID-related cancellations and fees (due to a travel ban, mind you) only resulted in false hope, which was actually worse than not having any coverage at all. In that case, at least you save yourself some money. To have \u201ccoverage\u201d felt misleading, in other words. And communicating with their support staff didn\u2019t leave us with any great sense of comfort either\u2014their \u201cindustry-speak\u201d conversations via email or phone always left us feeling like Seven Corners will make sure they have the last word\u2014and dollar.The reason why we didn\u2019t give them \u201c1 star\u201d however, is because at the very least they\u2019re letting us transfer the travel insurance over to our rescheduled trip (which was an issue in itself\u2014what is it with these travel agencies and not giving refunds?). We\u2019re not sure WHAT they\u2019ll be covering however, although if it involves \u201caccidental dismemberment\u201d, then we\u2019re golden. Given the quality of service experienced, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there's some hidden stipulation preventing anything\u2014including any loss of appendages, from being covered\u2014and in that case, we hope we\u2019ll never find out!Overall, a poor experience. The plan purchased turned out \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d, and even though we thankfully didn\u2019t lose an \u201carm and a leg\u201d, it\u2019s a lesson we learned the hard way.

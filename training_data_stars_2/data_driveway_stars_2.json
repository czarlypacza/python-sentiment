All \"Ford Gold CPO\" certified vehicles are guaranteed to have passed a set checklist to obtain this classification in order to advertise for sale as such, which the tailgate lock is specifically listed. People purchase these vehicles more confidently based on the fact they carry this classification, which Ford strongly enforces. This was not an \"as-is\" purchase but a Ford Gold CPO purchase with warranty, meaning the truck never should've been listed for sale unless and until it passed this certification. Heck, at the very least disclose the issue instead of hiding it until after the fact. Please think it through. BTW, I can send a signed copy of 7-day if you like.

I kept receiving emails that stated things needed done in a timely manner, but I couldn't reach anyone. I finally reached out to a supervisor that was able to help me with the remainder of the paperwork. They claimed they didn't have my wire transfer sent 3 days prior, which was very concerning! After it was located, I was sent to ANOTHER person who was a delivery coordinator. He was very responsive...at first.  He originally told me I would receive my new vehicle on Monday, September 9th. Monday came and went with no communication and no vehicle. Late Tuesday I receive a call stating that the delivery driver will be arriving late and will deliver my car the next morning. I ask if it will be delivered prior to 2 pm, as I had to go to work. I get a text response of \"I can't tell you that\". At this point I'm frustrated, worried I spent money on a vehicle I'll never receive, or a who knows. Finally, I get a message stating it will be delivered \"sometime after lunch\". Great! I will be here. Noon comes and goes and still no word. Now I'm freaking out. I reach out to 3 different people and no one is able to give me an estimated time. After a bit I get an estimate of 3-4 pm. Mind you, it's WEDNESDAY now. The vehicle was supposed to be here Monday!! I have to inform them that no one will be here due to my work schedule and my husbands schedule. I have to try to adjust the time to 5 pm so we can coordinate. I get a response of \"that should be fine\". At 4:26 pm I receive a phone call from an individual who spoke very broken English stating he couldn't come to my house to drop off the vehicle and he needed someone to meet him on the main road out from our house, which is a VERY busy main road. I tried to explain to him that our road loops around. He can make it. But he refused to listen. My husband jogged down to the main road and waited. Once the truck arrived he stopped part way in someone's yard amd part in the main road!! My husband had to try to direct traffic around the truck while the deliverer proceeded to offload my new vehicle into someone's yard, onto a busy road and back it into this other individuals driveway. Meantime the homeowner comes home and needs in their driveway now blocked by this truck and my new vehicle. Luckily, the homeowner was very sweet and understanding. After signing the papers my husband proceeds to drive the new vehicle back to the house where he realized he only had one key faub. SO, the next day I contact the company about obtaining another faub. I was basically told no. I got a response of \"typically used vehicles only come with 1 faub\". Not my trade in! It comes with two! No informed me it was missing a faub when I purchased it and it wasn't stated in the description that it only had one faub. Nice! Onto the 7 day trial period. I made a point to have the vehicle FULLY inspected, especially after the whole ordeal I had been through. Thankfully, things were in order and is a sound vehicle. I expected a phone call of some sort asking of I liked the vehicle or if I planned to keep it before they picked up my trade-in. Nothing! I got a phone call the following Wednesday to let me know they were coming to pick up my trade-in. We'll, ok then. Good thing I planned to keep the new vehicle. The pick up was very uneventful, thankfully, and they were able to come down my street...imagine that! At this point I am STILL waiting on plates and a title. My temp tags expire in 6 days.

I made an offer on a vehicle and worked with a representative to submit some easy paperwork/proof of identity. That part worked fine, good communication, easy working processes etc. I accepted their offer and made a $500 deposit. I was told that the actual dealership would be contacting me through a separate channel to arrange the sale - that was the first red flag. Totally different channel, new person, different incentives etc, as opposed to an online dealer like Carvana, which owns and sells their inventory directly. There's evidently also a lack of communication and coordination between Driveway and their \"partner\" dealerships, because less than a day later the driveway representative I was working with called to say that the dealership had already sold the car, despite me putting a $500 deposit on it.I went and checked the dealer's website directly, and the car is still for sale there. Maybe they just haven't updated their website, but something seems fishy - maybe the dealership didn't want to sell to me (I was paying cash). Many similar reviews stated that cars were pulled out from under people even after a deposit, although it sounds like most people get deposits back eventually. Maybe Driveway is accepting and then cancelling orders just to earn interest on the transitory deposits. Total speculation.

I had the vehicle inspected by my own mechanic the day after I received delivery. After I reported this to Driveway they honored their 7-Day Money back guarantee, but they reduced the amount of the refund by the shipping cost of $1,070.00 to deliver the car to me. The Driveway guarantee does state that \"the amount of the refund will be reduced by $1.00 per mile greater than 400 miles from the delivery date,\" and the car dealership was about1,470 miles away, so that was expected. However, I wouldn't have agreed to have the vehicle delivered in the first place if they had disclosed that there was a differential fluid leak which is a symptom of transmission problems potentially requiring costly repairs. I appealed to Driveway to refund the shipping charge but they refused, even though it appears they either intentionally or through negligence failed to disclose problems with the vehicle they supplied. If I hadn't hired my own mechanic to double-check their inspection work the problem might not have become apparent until after their 7-Day guarantee had lapsed. So Buyer Beware!

Kassandra finally reached out to me on Tuesday, February 6th which was 2 day before a week of owning the car. Kassandra failed to offer me a return of the vehicle, just only offered me a fraction of the repairs that need to be done with this vehicle. She wanted me to write this review. The money she claimed to make these repairs had a label made but never sent out in over 48 hours. Why wasn't I given options for my vehicle? It was within the window? She needs help with customer service skills, work on her responses to customers, and offer ALL solutions to a customer. All in all, I'm not thrilled with my experience with Driveway, I feel as if I was taken advantage of, disrespected, getting short changed, and doesn't fulfill their promises just like the Dealership salesman, John Hutchinson.

So long that the temp tags from New Jersey were set to expire 2 days after delivery. But Noemi got it renewed for us.Their DMV Specialist that we worked with did not document any of our calls, emails, or conversations. We even did a 3-way call with the Kansas DMV and the specialist and none of that was documented. The specialist insisted that we could just walk into the DMV and handle everything there even though she was told during our 3-way call that the DMV would only work with them since this was a 3rd party purchase.  The specialist went as far to state that she works with 30 states and knows what she is talking about. And then stated that we would have a license plate in hand in a week or two... and would not need a temporary tag from the state of Kansas. That was laughable. Why wouldn\u2019t we? The temp tag from New Jersey was expired.  It was literally exhausting dealing with her.   The only saving grace was Angie B escalating this to Patrik. He helped us and the fact that their specialist said everything was on track, but the temp tags had expired, I think they even realized something was suspicious with her documentation and the way she was handling the case. We would have had 3 weeks of no car because of our \"specialist\" mistakes.  Driveway rented a car for our daughter to use until her license plate came in. But a temp tag from Kansas came in a week later, and 3 1/2 weeks later her plates came in. I wish their  DMV specialists would know more about the states they are dealing with and listen to their customers and the Kansas DMV. That's what still gets me.

Edit: Not so much", "text": "What can I say, my first experience with Driveway.com has been stellar. Previously I've shopped with Carvana and they've been pretty capable, but Driveway is on a different level entirely. First off, Driveway's representatives, whether in sales (Angela, Deja), finance (Eric), or dispatch/delivery (Donte) have been kind, friendly, attentive, and expedient. I never had to wonder what was going on throughout the process, as they kept me informed pretty much all the time. Started the trade-in and sale process on the 25th of October for a car I liked in New Jersey (I'm in Georgia). They sent me over the forms to e-sign almost immediately after I talked to them and had overnighted the paperwork that needed to be physically signed the next day. I had the forms notarized and returned the same day and Driveway had already shipped my car to their hub in Georgia. The car got there on the 28th and was delivered to me just yesterday (October 31st). Granted I was on point with providing all needed information to them in a timely fashion, but the level of speed at which I had my older car picked up and the new one delivered within a week was pretty awesome. The car was as described and I'm extremely happy with it. The only thing I wasn't too happy about was that the dealership stuck a plastic dealer badge to the back of my car that I now have to work on getting off (note to new/used car buyers - tell driveway that you want the dealer badging/decals to be off of your car. It's a big PITA to deal with removing it afterwards). Other than that, I'm just waiting for the registration to be done after my 7-day/400 mile trial period of testing the car is up. I understand registration is a longer process so unless I'm still waiting 2 months down the line for registration (I'll update the review if that's the case), using Driveway so far has been an amazing experience, at least for me. They definitely have my business the next time I feel like trading up.Edit 12/7/2022: Still have been waiting on my tag for the past 5 weeks after I received the car. Since the car originated from New Jersey, that state does not issue additional temps tags by law (my temp tag expired on November 24th, 2022), and my home state of Georgia will not issue a temp tag for a car that originated from an out of of state dealership. Essentially, I have been stuck with a car that I cannot legally drive and have no recourse on it. For any prospective customers of Driveway.com: Driveway will be very communicative up until the point of sale, but after that, and especially when following up on tag/title/registration - the communication goes down a black hole. I've called numerous times regarding my tag and have requested call backs over the past two weeks, but have received ZERO communication back. Unfortunately, once they have their money/trade-in, Driveway seems to have an issue with the follow-up processes. I cannot in good standing advocate Driveway after this point.

I immediately got hooked up with a good salesman who walked me through the 1st phase of the buying process.  When that part was done I put down a $500 deposit.  My salesman then told me I would get a paperwork packet within 48 hours.  When I didn't get the packet after the 2nd day I got curious and decided to Google reviews on Driveway.com.  Boy, was I shocked!  I found over 400 reviews for this company and the majority of them were 1 star.  The site had given Driveway.com a rating of \"poor\".  The reviews stated over and over that Driveway had poor communications and an inability to get customers vehicles registered with DMV,  Many customers were stuck with cars they could not legally drive.  After reading bad reviews after bad review on multiple review sites, I felt It would be foolish to proceed with my order.  Buying a car \"site unseen\" on the internet is risky enough without having to see all these poor reviews on top of that risk.  The thing that bothered me the most is the lack of improvement I saw in these problems.  The latest complaints were from just two days ago!  The company is clearly aware of these problems because each review had a response from Driveway apologizing for the problems.  Yet, these problems continue.  How can a large car company like Lithia (Driveway parent company) not be able to get DMV paperwork done.  I feel I would be foolish to send them my $40,000 and trust that I will be one of the lucky ones that doesn't experience all these stated issues.I was very disappointed to cancel my order.  I was thrilled that I finally found the car that fit my budget and was pretty much what what I was looking for.  I was also excited that I would not have to visit a dreaded car dealership in person.  The car I wanted is now back on the website and is now at a cheaper price.  Perhaps they lowered the price because others were wise enough to check reviews on Driveway.com first.

On the plus side, I did get my deposit back with no problems.  I am very grateful for that.  Yet, I am still angry that I can not trust them enough to make a purchase from them.  The car I wanted is still on their site and it is considerably cheaper now then before.  But, I don't trust them to get my registration and title to me if I did order it.  The reviews on this site and Reddit are horrible!  The response I got from the company did not address any of these issues.  They only offered a 7 day money back guarantee.  How about fixing your problems...Geeze!  What good is a 7day guarantee when your paperwork doesn't show up 30 days after your purchase?  Why do people have to go thru all this agony.

Vehicle was delivered on time, but the dealership didn\u2019t provide me with a temporary tag or registration. I reached out to Emill for assistance, and he got me in touch with an individual that handled it, and they overnighted my temp tag and registration.Final stage \u2014 where\u2019s my permanent license plate and registration?!My temp registration was days away from expiring, so I contacted Emill (again), and he reached out to driveway\u2019s DMV department regarding the issue. A couple of days later, I was sent a text by an agent from said department, and they stated that their DMV vendor was still waiting for a check from the dealership to pay for fees and registration. I received this information a month after taking delivery of the vehicle! And it\u2019s information that I had to seek out. Anyhow, a few days go by and I don\u2019t hear anything, so I texted the same number that came from the DMV agent for information. She tells me they still haven\u2019t received the check from the dealership but the dealership is aware that it\u2019s needed asap, and she\u2019ll let me know when the dealer sends it. Frustration is starting to build. This is all happening after my temp registration has expired, and there was absolutely no sense of urgency from driveway\u2019s DMV person, like it didn\u2019t matter that I\u2019d had my vehicle for 30+ days and my paperwork still hadn\u2019t gone to the DMV to be processed. Hoping that I could speed up the process, I asked the agent if I could cover the cost of the fees (assuming they were just registration/tag fees), and the agent said their vendor can only take payment from the dealership, which leads us to today (38 days after taking delivery). Earlier, I received a text from the driveway DMV agent stating that the dealership realized they miscalculated the numbers on the contract, so now they aren\u2019t going to send a check to cover the fees and they aren\u2019t going to pay the $525 shortage (which is more than just fees, obviously), and now I needed to cover the costs in order for my vehicle to be registered. I replied back stating that I am not going to be responsible for fixing a calculation error they made on the contract, especially after 38 days. I also let the agent know that before signing the contract, I reviewed it line by line with the finance director. (I work in finance so I like to make sure everything is good to go prior to signing anything). The agent replied in a snarky way, basically asking why I was willing to pay for the cost before but not now. I told the agent that I was led to believe that the cost would be to cover small registration/tag fees, not a $525 dealer error. I said I wasn\u2019t paying for their error, and that I\u2019ll contact the dealer to flat cancel the contract and pick up their vehicle. Agent replied back stating it\u2019s too late and the dealer will be contacting me soon to collect payment. I told the agent I legally have every right to return the vehicle if there were items/costs that weren\u2019t disclosed on the contract at the time of purchase. I received a reply 4 minutes later telling me that the dealership has changed their mind and they sent a check. Wow. The agent was very unprofessional and rude. Let\u2019s see how long it takes from here.2 stars now. Still waiting for help\u2026Update\u2014 After multiple calls and texts with multiple reps, I was finally told that my deal is being sent to my local DMV, which is great, but now it\u2019ll take 2-6 weeks to get my permanent tag/registration. What a cluster! They need to fire their third party vendor, and then they need to completely revamp their approach to customer service and transparency. No one is on the same page there. It makes for an absolutely horrible experience when a major issue arises. Before the tag/registration debacle, I would have recommended Driveway/Lithia, but now I will tell anyone I know to go elsewhere. Hopefully they make some much needed organizational changes.  Im giving 2 stars vs 1 star because the initial process was good.", "rating": 2}, {"title": "Poor service. GO ANYWHERE ELSE!!!!", "text": "Poor service. Make sure you check your contract, ASK QUESTIONS and inspect the car yourself. I received with NO temp tags (from California) without any notice prior to purchasing, I got 1 key (with refusal to provide another and no disclosure until I got the car,) the car has no navigation chip\u2014 another couple hundred to purchase, the tires were bad and the alignment is so bad the car shook and made noises when driving it. Had the car 1 day and I\u2019m getting the run around about timelines for approving repairs. Now I\u2019m being told I may need to pay a diagnostic fee and I have to wait for reimbursement\u2014this is after I was told to take it to a local dealer. My 7days will run out and I only drove the car 35 Mi (23 to get it to the dealer)! They have no established processes, deadlines or real guarantees that will make you assured of their process. The chat will just say they will ask someone to reach out to you\u2014no answers. The people who are supposed to be your contact also act like they don\u2019t care. I purchased a newer Mercedes\u2014this is not the experience I have ever had with any car let alone a luxury vehicle. I have already filed a complaint with the BBB. This company only gets 2 stars for the ease of approval. The follow up is terrible especially if you have a problem.UPDATE: I just sent the info they requested. I will update again, on how this all was handled.UPDATE:  No one has contacted me yet. (Their last response to trustpilot was yesterday). Today is Wednesday (morning), I gave the dealers quotes on Monday (1PM, updated 4PM). Car arrives last Thursday and has been at the dealer since Friday. I have until tomorrow to give the car back under the 7day \u201cguarantee\u201d. It feels like they are playing a game of chicken, trying to run out the clock. I texted my \u201cprimary contact\u201d last night, and again about 20mins ago about getting confirmation of approval for the repairs.  No response so far. For reference, the car was shaking/ vibrating and making noises when driving. It is a real bad alignement and worn tires. The Mercedes dealer performed the diagnostic. Owning a luxury car is not cheap, maintence is a must. It is even more frustrating to have these problems when the vehicle first arrives, and you are looking forward to it\u2014especially after it was supposed to have been inspected. Right now I told my rep Lidia, via text, that I will return the car if they can\u2019t confirm that they will make the repair before my 7day period is up. I will update my review when I have more info.UPDATE 9/12: After lots of back and forth we suggested taking the car back to the partner dealership they delivered the car from\u2014they agreed to get the repairs there but that shop could not do it. They eventually mailed a check to pay for the repairs. That process took an additional 2 days (I insisted on express mail delivery). Ok\u2026 I\u2019ve come to terms with that\u2014now the repairs are done. NEXT\u2026. The temp tags\u2026 tired of playing a game of chance  with the GA police by riding with NO PLATES. I called the tags office myself. Discovered the delightful fact that I could get my own temp tags with the purchase agreement and the inspection. Great. I call Driveway and ask for the inspection which was supposed to happen prior to delivery. After getting the runaround since NO RECORD of an inspection was in their system (they could neither confirm or deny it took place), and fuming for about an hour about the ABSOLUTE ABSURDITY of this whole process and their supposed specialized departments, I have an aha moment and call the dealer that delivered my car and ask them for a copy. They claim they don\u2019t have it either. Apparently, they have a liason from Driveway at their site, who takes the car offsite to get the emission inspection  done\u2014he happened to be at lunch or otherwise unavailable. Fuming again for another hour. I decide to get my own inspection. I was literally in line at the emissions place when he called back. He emailed the inspection to me. Home to print it off. Next stop was the tag office and it was only a 1/3 success. Yes I got my temp tag. I should be jumping with joy right? No\u2026 they dated it to the date in the paperwork (9/9) which gave me all of 10 days to use my car\u2014and I was going out of town for 7 of them. SMGDH. Planned to drive my car out of town, but the temp tag was due to expire during that timeframe. When I reached out to driveway AGAIN before they expired & they said a rep would contact me. That was 5 days ago! Since then I\u2019ve contacted chat\u2014same response (someone will call me). Today I called again and the person I spoke to told me that apparently the dealership was missing some paperwork. Missing paperwork??? Are you kidding me? Now they are \u201cwaiting\u201d for the paperwork for review, THEN they will send it to my title office. It\u2019s been 25 days since the car was delivered and 34 days ago. So car payment due on the 23rd for a car I cannot drive.", "rating": 2}, {"title": "Lesson Learned!!!", "text": "So\u2026 Where do I even begin? My name is Jerome I started looking for a vehicle back in March. I found a car I was interested in and started the paperwork & made a $500 down payment. Didn\u2019t hear anything back, after 2-3 days I googled the selling dealership myself just to find out the vehicle has been sold! So I decided to give them another chance because I didn\u2019t really have time to take off from work to look for a car physically at the dealership. Found another car I was interested in, had to restart the process re-send all the paperwork I had originally sent in. Then the selling dealership was mailing paperwork to me, HELLO HAVE YOU HEARD OF DOCUSIGN?!! It\u2019s 2022!! Then Got the 2018 BMW within 3 days after sending the paperwork back. I really liked the vehicle and thought maybe it was worth it for a vehicle I wanted, AND I WAS WRONG. Received the vehicle March 28th. First off the brakes on the vehicle were grinding and shaking the steering wheel, had to replace all 4 brake pads and rotors and change the brake fluid. Attempted to contact the sales agent who initially completed the sale on my behalf, never heard from JR (name of the sales agent) again to this day. Ok so I bite the bullet because I liked the car and already received it. Then rolls around April 23rd, my temp tags are EXPIRED. After endlessly attempting to contact someone at driveway and getting no response regarding my registration, after a month and now my tags are expired, they tell me oh we\u2019re having issues with funding your loan. I\u2019ve already had the car for over a month at that point and was beyond furious that NO ONE in the entire company can tell me they needed more information from my employer to fund the loan. At this point I haven\u2019t heard from the initial sales agent by the name of Luis \"J-R\" Retana, and someone from the DMV department who isn\u2019t even in sales told me why they couldn\u2019t complete my registration because the loan wasn\u2019t funded is what baffled me, like what if I was to never endlessly call and ask for an update than I would never know. So I got with a very nice manager by the name of Chris Cook. He was very professional and worked with me to get my loan funded and was greatly appreciated seeing as I can barley get ahold of ANYONE to get me an update. I\u2019ve called and called and called the selling dealership and westlake financial the bank funding my loan and getting the run around each time. Ok so May rolls around and I get the loan for the vehicle finally funded thanks to CHRIS COOK, he went above and beyond for me always following up, keeping me updated and I appreciate it so much because without him I have no idea where I would be in the process. So now it\u2019s mid May and I\u2019ve been driving around with an expired temp tag since April 23rd, and if I knew prior I would\u2019ve been working on getting the loan funded prior to the temp tag expiring. Anyways now I\u2019m at the point where my car needs to be registered. My mother works with the Massachusetts RMV and in their system it says my car has been registered 05/03 it\u2019s 05/17, but where the h e double hockey sticks are my plates?!!!!! So I\u2019ve been calling driveway to find out if they\u2019ve even been mailed and when I will be receiving them and here we are again, no answer or response. I call in and they say each time \u201cwe\u2019ll add it into our issue log and they will call you\u201d sounding like a broken record because I never get any correspondence. I contact the selling dealership, Armando with DCH Kay Honda. He never even picks up the phone, I email him, text & nothing!!!! What is really going on here?! It\u2019s a never ending cycle. I would suggest to go through Carvana for the best online auto purchase experience. I would say it\u2019s too late and too much of a headache to give the car back and be done which I am very close to doing. I bought a car with Carvana before and there was minimal effort to do so and very user friendly, and I got my plates within 2 weeks of receiving the vehicle. After reading reviews of driveway I wouldn\u2019t recommend this company even to my worst enemy, had the worst experience start to finish which seems to be a common issue with alot of customers. Do not go with this company if you don\u2019t want the deal with back and forth BS, 2 months and counting to have the deal finalized and who knows how long it\u2019ll be before I have plates.UPDATE:got a hold of a supervisor by the name of Canela who was very nice and assured me she will get an update for me. After my conversation with her I received a text from someone named Antoinette that stated \u201cI will let your agent know to reach out to you\u201d hello I haven\u2019t spoken to agent Luis JR Retana since March I don\u2019t think he even is with the company anymore. Seems like their priority is responding to reviews & telling the customer whatever they want to hear just to get them off the phone. I ended up getting my plates at the end of may Since I\u2019ve had so many issues w/ the car.", "rating": 2}]

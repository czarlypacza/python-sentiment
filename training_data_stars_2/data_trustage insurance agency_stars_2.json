A woman tells me yes, they recognize I'm the POA but to cancel I need to talke to someone in cancellation dept who  informed me there is no form.

I had purchased a small life insurance policy and had a wonderful agent working with me, but after reviewing the cost I had decided it was too expensive for the low amount and decided to cancel the policy and look elsewhere.  I called and spoke to someone who said \"yes, we will cancel this for you\".  I then began receiving information regarding my policy in the mail and wondered if it had been cancelled.  I then began receiving e-mails about my policy and answered them to inform someone I had cancelled the policy and to please confirm this.  I received no e-mail, no written letter or phone call confirming this had been done.  A few weeks went by and still no confirmation.  I then decided to place another call this past weekend.  I just want the marketing department to understand what I dealt with and how this irreparably damages a company's reputation.  I called and spoke with someone who had difficulty understanding me and it took about 5 minutes just to get my name.  He then said he couldn't help me and had to give me another number to call.  I told him that I had just called that very same number.  He then gave me another number to call.  I placed the second call and was greeted with a unpleasant, non-smiling voice.  I explained my issue that I needed to speak to someone about cancelling my insurance policy.  After I explained this to her she then said \"why are you calling\"?  I had to repeat this again.  She then said \"well, I have to transfer you\"!  I thought she had transferred the call but she had heard me say \"Geez\".  I was surprised when she said \"you don't have to be mean, ma'am\"!  I said \"well I am sorry you were not very pleasant\".  She then hung up on me!!!  This was uncalled for and unprofessional.  She doesn't belong answering your phones.  I then recalled as I wanted to make sure I had confirmation on the cancellation of my policy.  A lovely woman named Cassandra answered the phone and I pleaded with her to just help me get this done!  She was very kind but then said \"I am so sorry but on the weekend we cannot transfer calls!  So, please reread that.  Does that in any way make sense?  You are better off from a marketing standpoint to have an automated voice recording saying \"Please call back during our normal business hours Monday through Friday\"!  Cassandra was kind enough to give me a few numbers so I could call today.  I called this am and was able to get confirmation that the policy was cancelled.  All of this could have been avoided if someone had just mailed me a notice of cancellation or a simple e-mail confirming this.  I do hope someone from the marketing department reads and reviews this.  I am writing this in an effort to help for future reference and teaching purposes.  Stay well in these difficult times.

Once I dialed the designated number:      - I was placed on hold for almost 45 minutes;      - I was given conflicting information related to navigating links listed;      - I was also transferred more than five times to different departments;      - In speaking across departments, my situation/issue felt nonexistent.In all honesty, I couldn't believe what I was dealing with. I would expect a corporate insurance company to instead conduct themselves accordingly:1) Reasonably safeguard while also maintaining confidential records;2) Maintain highly technical as well as sophisticated security software; 3) Prioritize the use of private security systems that:      - maintain integrity and operate efficiently;     - protect the safety of staff, operations, and most importantly clients;     - safeguard all types of confidential information and sealed records;      - release genuinely smart business advice with a heartfelt mission.Ultimately the reason I felt I had to write this review is to somehow finally get the attention of someone within this corporate insurance company that cannot seem to prioritize one of their former, loyal and now suffering individual clients.With that necessary and forced aforementioned review commentary with regard to this issue, I can only genuinely hope and pray that this is what it will finally take so that we are able to formally end this by NO LATER than tomorrow. I have MORE than earned the right to expect, request, and ultimately demand that your CMFG Life Insurance Company makes the less than 10 whole minutes of time to pick up the phone and dial my number immediately upon entering your facilities tomorrow morning... ALSO - just as a little reminder in case you happen to get distracted for whatever reason... just wanted to remind you that tomorrow's date is: TUESDAY, APRIL 6th, 2021. Unfortunately, I am compelled to both reiterate and stress the significance, the importance and the timeliness with which this particular issue is handled. Furthermore, in expressing my upsetting concerns through the course of this review, I genuinely expect that my long overdue policy cancellation request:1) Will maintain high priority with regard to overall timelines & efficiency; 2) Will be addressed immediately tomorrow morning, as soon as staff arrive at the office and then are subsequently briefed on the situation; &3) I most certainly expect my personal situation to be handled with:      a) Privacy and Professionalism.      b) Flexible & Positive Corporate Attitudes.      c) Receptive & Empathetic Feedback Upon Issues Surfacing.      d) Genuine & Meaningful Respect in Providing Varietal Solutions.P.S. Please call me tomorrow as discussed above so we can all finally be done with this issue. If I don't hear from anyone, I will continue to press forward in advocating for a complicated and unprofessional situation.", "rating": 2}]

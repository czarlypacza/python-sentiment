The mortgage agent contacted us an exorbitant amount of times to confirm information that had been previously communicated. Agent assured this was the \u201clast piece, or final hurdle to get to the finish line\u201d that was needed. But we would soon be contacted again for more info. Delays were due to incompetence & not my wife and I\u2019s financial standing.Some of the main heartburn I associate with New Day occurred as we inched closer to Closing. Brief setup- I was moving across country from 1 state to another. We moved at separate times (me first, & family to follow later). Had to do a split closing (wife in one state, and I in another). This was discussed with processing officer well in advance (3-4 weeks ahead of time). When I discussed issues surrounding our situation, I proposed several solutions ranging from power of attorney (to sign for wife), having her & I sign two different copies, faxing the papers, etc. Processor advised we had to proceed by wife signing papers a day ahead of time (at title company 6 states away), & then overnight docs to title company where the property was to be purchased. This was confirmed with processing officer on handful of occasions leading up to closing date of April 3, & also with both title companies, realtors, etc\u2014everyone was on board; or so I thought.Midmorning on April 1, after I had already long left my home state, I was pulling a 4,000 LB. trailer going 65-70mph on an unfamiliar road, I received a disappointing phone call from our processing officer at New Day. She informed me despite the plans, New Day was now requiring me to sign the documents first & then my wife. She advised this was bc I was the veteran and they needed it to be done in that fashion. I protested, explaining to her that I would not be in the state of my destination until April 3rd (day of closing). I also advised if we were to proceed down this potential route, I would not be able to get into the home on that date (which was a Friday) & would have to not only spend a minimum of three nights in a hotel (possibly longer), but I would have to return U-Haul before closing on house & would therefore have to unload all of my items from my trailer & pay for a storage unit or something to put them all in. After stressing the same points, I had expressed to her weeks before, and after checking with her superiors, she advised we could now proceed with the POA & that I could sign for my wife. Reminder: I had proposed this idea a month prior, only to have it shot down quickly. This is an oversimplification of what occurred. Changing the plan 36 hours prior to closing caused each respective title company & Realtors to also point out additional issues they themselves had with new plan. I continued to drive on, pulling my trailer, coordinating between these various agents & stakeholders, and containing my seething anger and indignation for the incompetence displayed at New Day USA. I have spoken with several people at New Day regarding my experience, & overall dissatisfaction & displeasure with their company. I want it to be known that I do not harbor any ill will toward them, do not have a hidden agenda, & don\u2019t seek to tarnish their reputation\u2014I want to warn any other potential Veterans of my true experience. Someone dropped the ball on our loan to cause this cluster- big time. I am of the opinion that a supervisor or someone who was charged with reviewing these plan & had them sitting on their desk & chose not to review the packages until last minute. This person\u2019s ineptitude, laziness, & lack of attention to detail, almost caused even more financial hardship to my family during this time of moving, floating 2 mortgages for short time, & dealing with the COVID pandemic.

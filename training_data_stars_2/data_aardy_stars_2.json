Not sure where the web processing messed that up, but certainly the checks for issuing a policy should ensure that the same person isn't listed multiple times. So then I had to call in to get the change made, wait on hold several times, receive instructions for how to modify the policy, and then find out it may take longer for that change to take effect than the time we'll be away on the trip!

Sorry we used iTravel thru aardvark. Seven Corners has an excellent reputation and honors their policies.

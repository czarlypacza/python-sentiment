One is estate tax, as that is ridiculous, as even foreign sellers are charging it , I feel is merely a ploy to bump up prices. Taxes online are for only for the state you live in, otherwise is wrong. So do others I know who also try to buy here, but find ridiculous \"Extra\" fees above actual mailing costs make buyers pass on purchasing.     Some sellers are fair, but others are just crazy.    I personally find myself perusing the site more than purchasing here, as pandemic + political craziness of not only inflating the prices of everything  by the misguided inept politicians who are not proven businessmen by pushing socialism. If it continues, Ruby Lane will go the way of the Doe Doe bird.       Of course this site bows to the government colluding to raise revenues by false means, as I know sellers who charge no tax on collectibles, + that prevents double taxing, putting money in peoples hands to spend as disposable income that is your life blood, instead of  giving it to those who refuse to account for how the government spends our money from these taxes, instead  funding terrorism supporting those in places like Iran, + Afghanistan, threatening freedom, restricting capitalism, yet pushing verbal Rhetoric to the opposite.      Ruby Lane should fight these changes that hurt buyers benefits of buying online, as everything the government touches ends up destroyed or severely compromised, this is the direction it is heading when theft is allowed in in person stores up to 999.00 before they will prosecute.        So, you see, WE are the lifeblood of your company, + if you stood on our side, goods people collected when they go to nursing homes would be sold through you if you were fair. Instead, you lose out on that $,auctions are the winners instead.          You think you are smart, but as our government pushes to create destruction of the economy, want another depression in order to achieve a national pro communist, socialist government contrived to destroy our founding fathers freedoms based on the US, constitution, your cooperation by excessive fees, will be the end of your business.          Estate tax is paid when items are sold by the principle initially selling their estates to their locality or government, NOT BY BUYERS ONLINE!  You must end this bad idea, only allowing sellers to charge actual shipping fees at the lowest rate or one day Amazon will take your sellers away, putting you out of business.            I suggest that sellers who want to sell high dollar items on your site in the tens of thousands of dollars be forced to sell through sites like Sothebys or Christies, not sell on Ruby Lane. Many of the items these sellers promote are questionable, difficult to chase after authenticating being from other countries,where legal costs+ court fees let alone the rampant fraud dealing across the ocean is impossible, must be discouraged unless there are international protections set in place, that are currently unavailable , or you must be legally responsible . But are not.         I have a lot of experience in online buying internationally , defrauding the US has become BIG BUSINESS for foreigners all across the world.       Mail fraud also is becoming predominant, as is excessive mailing fees internationally. These fees affect your business. Our own postal system is full of criminals, so are people stealing packages from porches. Until these issues afforementioned are all remedied, you can ask for advice, but do not accept liability, only want your money to get rich at others expense, so ...give that a think. These factors limit your success, as we didn't just fall off the turnip truck.  We know, you don't really care,or you would pressure governments to make necessary changes to protect buyers from these issues that impede security online. Until then, Good Luck !", "rating": 2}, {"title": "Rubylane is Horribly Overpriced!  Not Priced For Ordinary Folk.", "text": "I've been shopping antique furniture for a long time and decided to give Rubylane a try.  One thing I liked better than eBay is that most everything is offered to be shipped.  On eBay so few people and dealers want to ship anything and leave it to local pickup that it makes finding things next impossible because you are not able to eliminate local pickups from searches.Rubylane prices are so way out of line that I couldn't believe it.  Almost everyone is asking amounts for brown furniture in the price ranges of fifteen or more years ago.  The antiques market (brown furniture in particular), has been down for quite awhile now.  As far as European dealers are concerned, they don't balk too much, but here in the States there is a lot of whining and complaining about it, yet so few are willing to go the extra mile or even set up online antique collectives like they've been doing in Europe for so long.But the prices on Rubylane are way out of line.  I think it might be because dealers are expecting or hoping a lot of large city interior designers will pay those prices.  Maybe they do, but in my experience having worked for a NYC designer - not really.  Anyway, I just want to put my two cents in on this for any newbies out there thinking they may find a sleeper on Rubylane land.  Forget it, get out and check out the local dealers in your area - that is where the real deals are these days.RESPONSE TO RUBY LANE; Rob Spear, Senior VP of Customer SupportDear Mr. Spear;Thank you for you response but I do stand by my initial experience and review. I spent approximately four hours on Rubylane's site last night searching for various pieces for which I have priced similar counterparts elsewhere.  This included both internet dealers and brick and mortar stores, including the UK and France.  And no, I did not mean to imply that it was Rubylane who set the prices, but I think anyone with the least bit of internet shopping experience would see that quite clearly.However, I just purchased a turn of the century cherry etagere curio cabinet this afternoon.  It was in immaculate condition, with lamp shelves, glass cabinet doors and strong Art Nouveau elements.   It is a large piece and will compete quite ferociously with my French Provincial sofa where size is concerned.  I am sure there will be a pissing match between the two, but I've already declared no sides shall be taken and that they will have to work it out between themselves. :)   I purchased it today for less than $300 at an established brick and mortar.  It perhaps could have sold for $500 and much more fifteen years ago. I mention this only, because while on Rubylane I saw that prices for pieces of similar items where much much higher, sometimes many times higher.  This was more the rule than the exception and it applied to anything and sunder - furniture, jewelry, primitives, smalls etc.  Yet it was seldom found that a piece was important enough to justify those prices.  It would seem that the vendors on Rubylane are pricing their wares for the large metro markets.  And please it is not just Rubylane, but a number of other well known boutique sites as well. Please understand, my review was for the ordinary folk. . . the \"everyone else\", that exists outside and beyond the major metro markets.  And so this being a review site I felt the need to express my experience as such.  People will shop where they will shop and largely according to their means anyway.Besides, I am not the only person who has written a review noting Rubylanes high prices, I am simply testifying to their experience with my own.  It was precisely my curiosity on this very topic that led me to this review site in the first place. I was curious about how others felt about Rubylane's prices - I searched for reviews and lo and behold here I landed!So you see, I am only elaborating what others have already said regarding this issue here and on other review sites as well.So again, for the ordinary folk who are looking for a fair price on something of value - this is who my review was meant for.  Those for whom price is no concern would perhaps have found my review meaningless anyway.So, thank you again Mr. Spear.  I do understand you have a responsibility to Rubylane whom employs you so naturally it is within your best interest to plug the holes in the dykes where and whenever you may find them. One more thing, I never said I would never shop Rubylane again.  However, having seen the inflated pricing structure adopted by the vendors there, just makes Rubylane not the first place when looking for this or that.  Rubylane is still on my list, it's just not the first place on that list. Also, I do think it is important for those who are just beginning to venture into the beautiful world of antiques to realize is that they need to be careful if price is going to be a concern when perusing Rubylane.There are less expensive alternatives and you do not have to be wealthy to collect nice things.  You just need to be wary, take your time and not allow others to convince you of something if your inner wallet is snapping shut. :)  There is always an other \"one of a kind piece\" around the corner waiting for you to find if the one in your hand is just beyond your means.Best Regards and Be Well!Anthony", "rating": 2}, {"title": "Not Pleased", "text": "Item shipped immediately, received well packaged, however, item not as described.

However, since the website was updated, rhe shopping experience is not as fun.

The short text that gave some idea about the item is gone (still is) and the number of days from last update is missing which I discovered since can be found if you select the Edit button. There are still issues. Old site always retuned you to where you were. It's not consistent now. The email alerts is buggy. There should be a way to X out once read.

This was suspicious-- why would a vendor have an item, email confirmation they would ship upon return, and then say they couldn't find it?  Maybe not \"Ruby Lane\" fault, but vendors should keep agreements.\r A second vendor had an item (priced over $6K) that was clearly mislabeled as French porcelain, and implied that it has been made for Marie Antoinette!, as \"18th c. Queen's Factory Rue Thiroux, Paris porcelain\" when in fact it is a common pattern easily recognized as one by Coalport, an English maker.  I emailed Ruby Lane.

The vendor made little attempt to understand what I was asking, then asked me to wait as she had shipped item out, and she'd get back. I got back, resumed dialogue and in the midst of this was told they'd been just sold to a regular customer by phone. I liken this to a discussion over a piece with a vendor, where someone jumps in behind you , waves some cash and says I'll take it!    Not done..\rIn my view the vendor should have told me of the other interest, given me first dibs, as I had been conversing about this with her for over a week... Smacks of opportunism, and in the least, very rude. My thoughts are that she gave the heads up to her \"regular client\" that someone else was interested, and cemented a sale with a client who was more valuable to her for the future.

After second order I did not get any tracking number and when I asked for it I was ignored twice. At the jewelry shop where I checked the items I was told that such items cost around $ 5 each which means they make money on the shipping cost you cover if you join as an ambassador because you just overpay the real cost twice. I have requested chargeback, because I think it's not a British company, their items are fake even when look good and in general it looks like another scam scheme.", "rating": 2}, {"title": "Is Vanessa Flair a legit company?", "text": "In July Vanessa Flair has been approached me by social media for asking me to become their ambassador. I accepted to try the products and I made my order which was charged for about 30\u00a3 when their site claims for free shipment. It wasn't free. This is the 1st red flag. They shouldn't ask the ambassadors to pay shipment when they make over 90\u00a3 order.The 2nd red flag is when I have discovered that the same products are being selling in another platforms for ridiculous low prices. This fact made me think that this company maybe is a scam.I also checked that the address in London they provide seems to be valid as many companies are housed there, but Vanessa Flair isn't registered in the official list of all of them. This is the 3rd red flag.A month passed away without receiving my order. Although the company has sent me an email that they have been informed that I have already received the package, I replied them that is not true and that they should fix this. Eventually they did.The jewelry I received are indeed gold plated but seems poorly made and faux that they don't justify the high price. I give 2 stars because I received my order at least.", "rating": 2}, {"title": "The webshop is selling products from\u2026", "text": "The webshop is selling products from other companies, and the prices are really high for products that are originally between the 1-5 euro", "rating": 2}, {"title": "Necklace got discolored", "text": "I purchased a pair of earrings ,bracelet and a necklace..pair of earrings were okay.

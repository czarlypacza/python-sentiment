I responded that I didn\u2019t know which bank account I\u2019d used and asked them to let me know which so that I could send the proof.

I needed a way to get cash out using another means, so I tried setting up Western Union. There was a problem with the transfer due to my middle name not matching, so I updated my bank details all good by contacting my bank. However, the Western Union app wouldn't allow me to update my middle name to match, so I ended up calling up their customer support. The man on the other end said he couldn't do it for me, so I explained the situation to him and he put me on hold, but he never returned to the call after 30 minutes and the phone hung up.I then decided to email them instead. I explained the situation, but the first steps they gave me were wrong, so I explained again and they sent me updated instructions, as well as unverifying my profile so that I could make edits. Despite my profile now being unverified, the updated instructions they sent me in the following emails did not work, their app/website did not match the instructions sent. I had to update my middle name, which their instructions to update in the app/website did not work, as either text box did not exist or it was greyed out.As a Software Developer, I know how apps and websites work, and as I didn't seem to be getting anywhere with their support instructions, I ended up creating a new account, which allowed me to update my middle name properly as expected. Therefore, it just goes to show that their app/website is broken and needs fixing when it comes to updating personal details, and I felt like they were not taking my emails seriously enough when I needed their support in an emergency situation. I also find it unbelievable that in 2023, they are not able to update your personal details for you when going through an emergency, like any other bank or financial organization would.Now that I have created a new account, the transfer works fine.

As well as have the staff in DR need to understand their only concern in a receiving transaction is to make sure that the government issued document matched that in the system. After having to take a taxi to an additional 47 minutes drive to another location due to not enough USD at the location in Elias Pina. I took a cab to Las Martas, I couldn't receive my money. Money I sent to myself because I was traveling.  After they asked me who sent the money,  I answered,  \"I did\". I was told that the name of the sender doesn't math the name on my passport! I told them the sender's information isn't their concern. They said the middle name isn't in the sender's portion. I asked how's that their business. I then called customer service which informed there's nothing wrong with the transfer, however they would not speak to the agent at the counter. To make a long story short,  I wasted a lot of time and money traveling just because the problems exist in the outside of the United states and I think it's because the Western Union headquarter doesn't care enough about those authorized branches' customer service experience.  I think that's a lot of trouble I had to go through for such a low risk transaction.

Their onboarding does not ask for any ID prior to a transfer.  When I tried to make my 1st/only transfer using my bank info, it failed instantly.  I then tried my debit card...same.  No reason, just 'contact the call center.' Calling them (and/or chatting w WU) is a fools errand.  They use a 3rd party BPO that appears to be bottom rung.  Agents suffer through english comprehension and are terribly untrained.  They constantly put off the customer claiming a reply will come via email...which never does.Someone finally told me my account was 'unverified' and sent an unclickable link in chat where I may upload my passport.  But it didn't work...despite switching browsers and clearing cache.  Finally sent it to an email they provided, which is insecure.  There is no conf mail sent confirming receipt and despite claims of a '2-hour turnaround' one never came.

Ensure representatives communicate clearly and verify all critical details upfront to avoid costly assumptions. Never make assumptions about the nature of funds without proper verification.3. Provide consistent and timely updates throughout the process to reduce client stress.4.

I am my fathers power of attorney, and his home is in trust. He was diagnosed with lung cancer last year, and we needed to refinance his home, because my mother passed away last year, and he just couldn't afford the mortgage payment on his own. I was tapped out on my savings as I had quit work to take care of my mother as she battled chronic and severe illness. I reached out to the first Rocket agent, and he took too long to even respond, so I tried to reach out again. I was able to speak with another agent, and I communicated the situation, and that, as my father's POA, I wanted to get his home refinanced for him. The agent said that the process would likely only take a couple of weeks. Well, a couple weeks turned into almost two MONTHS. I had to submit and then re-submit our POA documents as they were somehow unable to be found in the system, then I submitted our trust certificate, THEN was told I needed to upload the trust in its entirety. At that point I became frustrated, and had some questions about the details and numbers of our loan, and the agent I was dealing with said he would check on those numbers, and get back to me later in the afternoon. I didn't hear from him again until a week later, and he didn't reach out to answer my question. He reached out because he had a question about our trust. I reached out to Rocket to ask for another agent or to just call everything off, and was then put in touch with someone higher up that was brought in to help salvage the situation. We got to the next step where we had to deal with amrock, and the woman there was quickly replaced when neither myself nor the Rocket agent helping us could get answers from her, as she didn't seem to be too concerned with helping us. After that I was told that the doctors note I submitted for my father wasn't sufficient. I was forced to get THREE additional doctors notes as each proved to be insuffienct in different ways, despite the fact that I did exactly what was asked. We started this process on February 12th, and our loan didn't close until the first week of April. All I wanted to do was help my dad stay in his home as he battles cancer. It was made clear from the beginning that we intended to use our POA to refinance his home, and we were met with road block after road block in the form of either apparent disinterest or miscommunication. Rocket seems to be so compartmentalized that once a person gets their job done, the case is sent downstream without any context or communication. I don't understand how agents told me that everyone involved was \"on the same chat thread\", yet the whole process managed to be so incredibly disjointed. I will say this, agents that I spoke to were respectful and showed some empathy for what my father was going through, but, the road my father and I took to get his home refinanced through Rocket was the exact opposite of a smooth and enjoyable experience.

We have never had an issue with our old loan (we refinanced during the rate drop with Rocket and had a great experience). When we went to purchase our new home, we shopped for rates, and found Rocket was one of the most competitive. Our Loan Originator (Aaron Nason) was INCREDIBLY helpful. He listened to what I wanted from our loan and was able to get us a good rate. He even helped answer questions throughout the process and helped me understand closing costs (and went to bat for us to try to understand why we were getting screwed out of so much $ by Rocket--see below). Literally, if I was only rating Aaron, it would have been a 5 star review. Fast forward to submitting our documentation; it was a complete mess. The processor (Star) was really sweet,  but sometimes struggled with explaining what the underwriter wanted from us. We submitted EXTENSIVE documentation (we had a gift, numerous financial statements, W2s, etc.) proving we had more then needed, but still were told to resubmit THE EXACT STATEMENTS  (so that the underwriter would actually look at them) again to prove our funds. This became incredibly frustrating, since we overall had a super straightforward loan. Finally, got through all of the documentation. Star was very sweet and very patient; I have submitted a review separately for her, but she would also get a 5 star review. On to the closing process, which was absolutely a miserable experience and should be completely unacceptable. We were advised (by Rocket) to purchase our insurance in advance of close and pay directly to the insurance company. This lowered our cost-to-close. We then received a 5K sellers credit and had about 1K in Rocket rewards to go toward closing costs. We submitted ALL of our insurance documents 6-days before close, and received a prelim cost-to-closing statement that still included $2,700 charge for insurance. I was the one who caught this mistake (after I had asked multiple times for this to not be even included from the get go since I was already working to purchase it) and IMMEDIATELY requested this be removed to get an updated cost-to-close. Mike Capaldi assured me it would be removed before close and my costs would be updated. 36 hours before close, I received a call from Mike telling me that because I purchased insurance separately, I did not have enough closing fees and had an excess of closing credit and would basically be missing out on $1,700. I was informed that usually I would be asked to buy down the rate, but since it was so close to closing, that if I did this we would have to push back closing (which is not an option as we needed to vacate the house we were selling on the close date). Meaning that I would basically be leaving $1,700 on the table. Being told this was incredibly frustrating and completely unacceptable. We negotiated for that $ for repairs on the house and were expecting to use it to do so. I submitted my insurance information 6-days in advance and Rocket decided to wait until 36-hours beforehand to basically tell me I had no options at that point since closing was so close and that I basically would miss out on it. We ended up having to purchase a home warranty (which we never wanted and do not expect to use) and worked with Mike to get our Rocket rewards $ back so that we could instead use our sellers credit. We ended up missing out on a few hundred dollars, but Rocket's inability to change our closing costs to give us any options after 1) I submitted documentation 6 days in advance and 2) I CAUGHT the mistake immediately (about 5 days in advance) was just shockingly disappointing. We were then given updated \"final estimated\" closing costs the night before close. Then ON THE WAY TO CLOSE, we received a call telling us that those numbers were not accurate and increasing our closing cost about $2,000. To not receive accurate closing numbers until LITERALLY 15 MINUTES BEFORE CLOSE is so stressful, disappointing, and overall just wrong. We basically had no choice at that point but to move forward, regardless of how much money we ended up leaving on the table. Any push back from us, and we would have literally been homeless with a 16 month old baby, while I am also 17 weeks pregnant. Overall, just really disappointed in how the close was handled.

The loan processor told me this was impossible for all the differing accounts, but I could pay of the vehicle myself. All the others need to be paid in the closing as a condition of getting the loan. He also stated all the loans would be paid by electronic payment so there would be no delay. I have refinanced before and this was not a condition so it took me by surprise, but after some discussion I agreed. To my great surprise I learned in the closing documents that the payments were not to be paid by electronic payment, but paper checks would be mailed to me and I had to mail them to each debtor. Not a good time to learn this. My choice is to either except it or cancel the loan and pay back all the cost of processing the loan. This mailing to myself and then me mailing to the debtor added several days to the payment process. This time delay added interest cost on each loan.  Then to add insult to injury when the checks were mailed to myself, they were mailed without the requirement of a signature and the mail man just lest them on our porch while we were gone.

My main complaint is that they should be way more detailed in just exactly what all is needed as far as documentation and requirements to close the loan, provide a time line for when these will be needed (and when updated versions would be needed if things get delayed). If they do as many loans in the US as they say they do this is a no-brainer. NOTHING should be left to last minute or surprises.

So many things should have been done before the week of.  We couldn\u2019t arrange anyone to help us move, or tell our jobs when we needed to be off due to having to wait until less than 24 hours before we closed to have confirmation we were actually going to be able to close.

They then said we were approved for $50,000, pending UW review. Unfortunately, they ran a hard check again dropping my score to 176,(even though legally they should only run this ONCE in a 3month period) & they said they couldn't approve that. I paid a credit card down and my score went to 185. Then they came back and said that they couldn't do the $50,000 because it was too risky for them (they have our first Mortgage, a 30yr at 3%) Appraised at $500k and the first at $392K, is about 78%; adding a $50k note is about 88%LTV. (still under the advertised 90%). Then they said that if we have them Pay Down our first by $18k (they roll it into 1 loan at $42k), they could then make it work and give us $24k cash.  Essentially they traded $18k at 3% for 11.5%, saving Rocket money! The whole transaction would put us at 83%LTV. There was 1 other pre-approved, then denied transaction in between these other 2. Rocket (Amrock, their title Co. affiliate) ran our credit score 3 times within 2 weeks, dropping my score each time. The whole process was stressful and took too long. Although it appears probably cheaper than a personal loan we keep getting offers from some of our existing banking relationships (like Bank of America) at 6% for a HE Line (not even a full paid loan).

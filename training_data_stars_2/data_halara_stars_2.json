Opened the package, fabric soft and stretchy. I tried them on, very comfortable, light, easy to squat, I thought theses are so far the best quality trousers that I have ordered through online. Day 1 - Worked in retail for 8 hours with these trousers. I was wearing long t-shirt with these trousers. Got home, changed my t-shirt and when I looked down I had a hole under the front zip. I was angry, because I spent that money and on day one already a hole. Okay, I thought I can fix and when I started sewing I noticed that part was very poor stitch from manufacture company or whoever were sawing these trousers together. All fixed now, so I was fine with it. Day 2 - Another 8 hour shift. Trousers still feel amazing, light and perfect material, all the dirt and dust that I usually get in retail comes off easily. Went to toilet and front main button pops off. And I was like ... what else now? Luckily I had long t-shirt that was hiding everything. Got home and fixed the button.On next day button popped off, because of my poor stitch. Im still wearing these trousers, but they are not worth that high price. Thats why I give two stars instead of one, because company is good, just the price is way too high for that specific product.

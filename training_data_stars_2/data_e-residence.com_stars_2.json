He asked me about some documents, but when I sent these documents, he said that they don't accept it. Also, he didn't say what document they required. I asked my manager at the e-residence about what document I needed to send, but they didn't help. In the end, the E-residents manager said that the bank doesn't open accounts for people from Russia.

This is beyond frustrating and will have to take steps with the credit card company to avoid recurring charges.If your situation in your home country delays your relocation, please be aware that cancelling recurring charges and removing them as your representative is going to be challenging.Your credit card company may have to get involved.I recommended them for fast service.

I called Dugood to arrange to have money sent to the account to cover the outstanding balance, but the bill pay company sent my account to collections without even talking to me about anything.

I was shut down by the Jada Kelley call center.  I was not even allowed to start the loan request application.Bottom line, the Jada Kelley Dugood FCU is out of touch with the members of the credit union she dictates.It took over 45 minutes to get the loan advance.

The ladies said that dugood bank is a second chance bank and  would help people with small loans to repair credit. . So i waited at least a month, then  went in Monday Dec 3 to give dugood  a try. I brought my 3 year old with me because she had just had surgery and was still wearing  a neckbrace.  A lady walked me into her office,  she never introduced herself. Then in the middle of opening my account walks in another lady. She never introduced herself either. They both were just looking at me and my child funny.  Both were in the computer trying to figure out how to complete the questions i guess, because no one was saying anything. They were not very friendly. Finally they finished. I had a check i wanted to deposite. Low and behold they wouldn't  cash it. It would take 6 business days to appear in my account. They should have said that upfront.  I need to pay my rent by the 5th. I cant wait 6 days. Then i applied for a small loan at this \"second chance bank\" and low and behold i didn't get approved. This is not what i expected.  And the service was horrible.  Workers need to talk more and be friendly. No one in that location was nice. Its like the workers were mad at each other.  Atmosphere was cold with bad vibes.", "rating": 2}, {"title": "Lupe was dismissive and impolite.", "text": "Date of experience: July 27, 2019", "rating": 2}]

At the time, it was next to impossible to find a bank that offered HELOCs on an investment property. However, their fees are high. They make you draw all the money off the loan when you first get funded and I paid about 3% on the funds up front. I paid back what I didn\u2019t need right away to lower my monthly payment. But when I got ready to draw additional funds, that is when things got confusing. First off,  It was different interest rates depending on when I drew. So part of my loan was at 11% and another part was at 12%. I received different statement amounts due for the month. Then my minimum payment due went up by 30%! I ran all the numbers and it still didn\u2019t make sense. Even with all the money drawn, at the max interest rate, amortized over 30 years, I should have been paying no more than approx $535/month.  But they were charging approx $850/month on a $50,000 loan amortized over 30 years at a max interest rate of 12%. When I asked about this, They came back with something about me drawing more money off the line on a certain day. So they had to re-amortize my loan. Had I not contacted them, I still would have been paying 30% more. That math was not \u201cmathing\u201d. Why was I paying $300 more per month? Why was I getting different statements with different amounts due for the same month? I finally refinanced with a credit union. There were no upfront fees, I didn\u2019t have to draw all the money off the line, the rate was fixed and lower (for an investment property), and my minimum payment due is 1% of the loan, no matter what day of the month I take a draw.

The process was pretty easy to get through and I was very satisfied with the experience. When I decided to refinance my principle mortgage and consolidate my debt, Figure seemed like the natural choice.  I was refinancing to lower my monthly payment amount so I could prepare for retirement in 10 years.  When I initially started the loan process, I had options to pay to reduce the interest rate, but the rate and payment they offered was in the range that I wanted so I opted not to pay to reduce my rate.  I started the process and locked in my rate.  Once I was locked in, the process became complicated.  Instead of a check list letting me know everything I would need to prepare, it was one thing at a time and it seemed like I was dealing with Columbo...\"Just one more thing.\"  I suppose for people who have their own scanners and save everything electronically, the process might be easer, but for me it was a nightmare.  For every \"one more thing\" I had to find the information they were looking for, leave my house to use a scanner, send it to my e-mail, then go home to load it in on the Figure website.  By the time, we got to the appraisal phase, a lot of time had been wasted on all those back and forth trips.  Unfortunately, there was an issue that came up during the appraisal that had to be corrected before the loan could go through.  I had the work completed as quickly as I could but due to issues I could not control, it took several weeks.  When the work was done, I got a generic e-mail stating I was approved for the loan at almost a full percentage point higher than what I had originally \"locked in.\"  The payment was almost $200 more than the original terms and out of the range that I wanted for retirement.  I understand that circumstances might have changed during the loan process, but nothing about the rate increase was communicated to me by my loan officer...just a generic e-mail.  Also, I was upset that Figure could change the terms but I did not have an option to do so.  I could have reduced the loan amount request as I had already paid off almost $7000 in debt while the loan process was going on.  I could have opted to pay the points and reduce the interest if I had been given an opportunity, but I was not.

I have no complaints about the Home Equity product that Figure offers and none about its customer services staff - Daniel, Roderick, and another chap, each of whom was extremely professional and extremely helpful.      Your website needs to be more user friendly.  Adjusting the loan amount is not obvious that you have to use the slide bar and nothing on the screen told you to use the slide bar, consequently my application was delayed for a day because I could not adjust the loan amount and had to cancel my first application.  The second and by far, the WORST problem on the application is the four attachments the customer has to read and sign.  The fourth one is about 15 pages long.  The quality of these attachments is EXTREMELY POOR.  First the font is way too small and the contrast of type color and background very poor, and for me, impossible to read on the screen. I decided to copy it and paste it in Word - the formatting was ridiculous in Word and I spent almost four hours adjusting the format in Word so that it would be reasonable as I adjusted it from 27 pages to about 15. Daniel then suggested I do a \"control plus\" to make the font larger, which worked for some type and for others the font washed away completely into wavy shadow like lines.        I believe it is absolutely unbelievable that a company lending large sums off money could possibly have such an inept and incompetent attachment that was critical for the customer to read and for completion of the lending process.  This problem delayed the completion of my loan by 4 days (still not completed) and as I write this I am so incensed at such incompetence that I am wondering if Figure is just another corporate entity that takes unfair advantage of its customers by giving them barely readable \"fine print\".  You must admit that the recent economic collapse revealed how banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions lied and took unfair advantage (cheated) of their customers in processing financial instruments, so one's suspicions of your ethical standards in light of a critical attachment that is unreadable is very understandable.         Under no conditions should your website/application cause me or any customer to do hours of work just so they can understand the fine print.  Then again, maybe most customers do not read the fine print, but I do.  I strongly suggest you correct/improve these attachments immediately.", "rating": 2}]

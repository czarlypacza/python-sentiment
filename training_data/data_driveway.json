Definitely agree with the sentiment of most people here that communication between departments is lacking. MASSIVE shout out to Cheyenne, my delivery coordinator, for being the only person assigned to me that I could get a reply from. She was extremely helpful, prompt to reply, let me know when she was going to be out of office\u2026 10/10 there. The other departments, especially contracting, could use some improvement in their communication. I reached out to my contracting agent several times for questions and never heard back. My car was delivered 4 days ago and I still haven\u2019t received my retail contract. Online chat support was helpful in giving me updates and adding notes to my account, but couldn\u2019t do more than ensure someone would follow up (and most of the time, they didn\u2019t).The process was straightforward. Put in request for car, got approved, sent $500 deposit. Uploaded all of my documents (insurance, ID, etc.). Waited for overnighted paperwork that took 3 days to deliver. Got that notarized at UPS and sent it back. Wired the rest of the down payment, and then waited to hear back. Stay communicative to keep the ball rolling. You might not hear back, but patience is definitely key here. You wouldn\u2019t buy a car online if you wanted it instantly. After a few days my contract was approved and delivery was scheduled. The car/delivery itself is also just OK. I didn\u2019t live near any Lithia dealers, so a 3rd party delivery service brought it to me. They gave me a 10 minute heads up that they were about to be at my address, which is a little short notice but thankfully I was already home. About 10 minutes for them to take their pictures and inspect, sign the delivery confirmation on their phone, and done. Car had a few problems I\u2019ve noticed so far. For reference, it\u2019s a 2021 Civic with 39k miles. I\u2019ll be taking it to get a PPI today and will update my review depending on that. No issues/accidents were listed on the listing/CARFAX. However, both key fobs were completely dead, and one of the physical keys won\u2019t fit in the door. The skid plate under the car is partially hanging. It seems to pull left and has something rattling in the back. Additionally, one of the tires was significantly under-inflated, so I\u2019m assuming a leak, and all but one of the valve stem caps on the tires were missing. Needs new wipers and it was pretty dirty too, but that\u2019s an easy fix. Overall, an OK experience so far, and we\u2019ll see how long it takes to get my plates/registration as I know that\u2019s a later roadblock for lots of folks. Just try to stay in contact the best that you can, but expect some delays and have some patience. The agents have 2 days off a week that you might hear nothing, that\u2019s normal. My time from request to delivery was 10/20 to 10/31, so only 11 days. ",

        "text": "I never thought in a million years I would ever purchase a car online without seeing or test driving, but I have to say it works.  I also would've loved to rate my experience higher, but the communication was TOUGH.  The review score of a 3 ( in total for Driveway)- is only because the car is super nice. I have to say I did get a beautiful car out of the deal - but it was very stressful at times.   I think the whole point of using an online dealer is to AVOID the hassles of a dealership - which was my thought process going into this.  Because of this - I believe Driveway is only shooting themselves in the foot - and losing a large clientele because you will never earn their trust with their current reviews (38% - Rate only a 1) with communication being the common complaint. THIS WAS MY EXPERIENCE;  sales people will be all over you to get the sale, BUT once that takes place - that's it!  There is not a representative assigned to you once the sale is done. Which there should be.  You find yourself floundering and asking people that cannot help you because it's not their job and you STILL have questions once the sale is complete.  You will get text messages where they do not even identify themselves - and at the beginning I thought they were scams ( and didn't pay attention to them).  I was assigned a wonderful (again I do not even know her title) sales person, let's call her, who did a great job to help get through the process and the red tape.  I reached out to her many times only because she was the only one to get back to me via phone or text me consistently. The individual that set up my delivery was also wonderful.  So the car gets to me, and as another reviewer stated, much to my surprise there was only ONE key/fob.  Apparently, because there was a picture of the ONE key sitting on a seat of the new car - I was suppose to assume that there was only one key fab?? I don't think so.   It also came with a BIG scratch that I did not see.  I did bring it to an auto body shop friend and he stated it was definitely a new scratch - which leads me to believe that it happened in the delivery process.    Maybe because the car was black and the pictures were not great - of which I asked over again to get better pictures, I therefore, never saw the scratch.  The  Customer Resolution team was of no help at all - NOW if I ever want someone to do business with my company again- I would do everything in my power to keep a positive relationship going.  No one was willing to get a quote for a new FOB (because it's much cheaper for a dealer to get a fob than a customer), to get me another key or even research the scratch.  It's called disclosure- no one along the way disclosed either of these things to me.  Watch the FINE print I guess.  That was an easy fix. Well, that was my experience,.  I love, love, love the car.  You can make the decision to move forward from reading not only my review, but others.   Driveway still has many things to improve on and I hope they do - because the concept is wonderful.

At first, I was skeptical and thought it would be complicated to sell the car online. However, it was easy as 1 2 3 through Driveway. The transaction was smooth and straight forward. I would definitely recommend my family and friends to Driveway.This is how it works, Driveway send out both the online electronic Docusign through email and physical paperwork overnight to you with instruction where to sign it. You sign both the electronic and physical paperwork and postmark the physical paperwork within 3 days in the provided UPS envelop.  Once Driveway receive and process the paperwork, the car would be scheduled for pickup depending on where you live. Driveway then send a U.S bank link over email for you to fill in your banking information. Keep in mind, when the car is picked up onto the transport trailer, just snap a photo and send it to Driveway dispatch team. Call dispatch team for confirmation and the fund would be release to your banking account. That's it.",

He really went out of his way to contact the dealer and have them send me extra pictures.After deciding to make my purchase, I was passed along to dane, who was my go to guy for the delivery after delivery process. Dane was truly outstanding and answered a million questions on my part. There was a few issues with the car upon receipt that I was not aware of. Dane took it upon himself to reach out and get these small issues resolved and really went to bat for me and made me feel really great about the choice I made which made me happy with my purchase even though I had a seven day return window. If I'm being honest if it wasn't for these 2 gentlemen and their outstanding customer service, this would have been a  not so great experience. With that said every thing turned out great and I highly recommend the Driveway experience. I will definitely be back again if I have any future car needs.Also  a shout out to all the young ladies in the title and shipping department that helped along the way.

I was told my vehicle would arrive on a Thursday,  instead it was delivered on Sunday afternoon. To me Driveway customer service seemed disconnected. Not enough communication between driver and them.... Overall it gave me anxiety not knowing when vehicle would be delivered. Dates kept changing along with customer service giving me different delivery dates. Again, I had zero clue the driver was making other deliveries. Definitely need to work on some sort of tracking of vehicle for the customer.  I honestly expected a smooth transaction, but was disappointed. Vehicle arrived unharmed.  However when I drove it I noticed transmission issues. Took it to Nissan dealership here since it still has warranty.  Also missing handbook but honestly the one that was send to me digital was just how to adjust seatbelt and such.

The Tundra we purchased through Driveway was shown by the included Carfax, to have been fully serviced and Toyota Certified by Lithia Toyota of Missoula, Montana. Once the truck arrived we found that the A/C did not work, the tail lights did not work, the trailer light plugs did not work, the wiring harness had been ripped out of the back of the truck, the engine leaked oil, and the shocks were blown. It seems that they falsified the Carfax report or they lied about inspecting the vehicle. To top it off, after having a mechanic show us all of the things wrong with the vehicle and documenting it with photos, Driveway had the audacity to say it was insufficient proof of the vehicle's condition and that they were still going to charge us the transportation fee to send the vehicle back. We never would have purchased a vehicle in such bad condition. Negotiating the return of the vehicle has been just as disappointing. Each time the customer service rep. says that her manager will call us to help, it never happens. Each time the customer service rep. said that she would call us back, it would never happen and I had to follow up every time. All in all, I suppose the only good thing about Driveway is that they will take their vehicle back within 7 days.",

It's true you get bumped to a new \"specialist\" at every turn and step of the way, but at least everyone on my team was fast acting and responsive. I felt everything went smoothly EXCEPT for the actual delivery, which I believe could be improved on as an overall process:  1. The first driver missed the originally scheduled pickup. I wasn't informed of this until the day before delivery was supposed to occur. I could have been informed the day after it was missed.  2. I received an email when the vehicle was picked up stating my delivery date and time of 9am. I stayed home from work. 9am came and went and I called driveway and was told \"the system\" sends random times. Isn't that something you can just remove from your automation and/or repair?  3. Asking for a more specific time frame was impossible because of how many departments between Driveway and the shipper needed telephoned through for any information. Ultimately the driver didn't arrive until 8:30 pm. The policy of them calling you when they are 1-3 hours away is also too narrow of a time frame - not everyone has a job they can just run off from at a moment's notice and go home to receive a vehicle. If I had better communication throughout the day, I could've gone to work and not waited all day and evening.   Anyway, delivery issues aside, the vehicle is in good condition, and the dealership sent me photos of some paint damage before I committed to purchasing it, which I appreciated the integrity there. The damage is insignificant, especially after a detail, and I find Lithia to be a reputable dealer. I'd do it again, but I'd still be prepared for another delivery headache. ",

        "text": "My experience with Driveway has been a nightmare filled with delays, misinformation, and irresponsible advice. I purchased a vehicle from Driveway and expected a smooth registration process, but since October 3, I've faced endless setbacks and a complete lack of accountability.On October 3, Driveway requested my insurance verification and state emissions test documentation, which I promptly provided. Despite confirming receipt of these documents, Driveway repeatedly requested my insurance card over the following weeks. When I reached out for updates, they assured me my paperwork was in progress, only to later reveal that they hadn't submitted it to the DMV until October 17\u2014**two full weeks** after I sent everything required on time. This delay has left me with temporary plates valid only until October 31.As that expiration date approaches, I\u2019m left in a terrible position, unable to legally drive the car I\u2019m paying for. Despite the urgency of this issue, every attempt I made to speak with a manager was met with vague promises and no formal response. Shockingly, when I explained that my plates were set to expire, Driveway actually suggested I drive without proper registration\u2014completely disregarding the fact that my state imposes severe penalties for this, including potential arrest and impoundment.Their refusal to expedite my registration or provide any temporary solution, such as rental reimbursement, is costing me financially and emotionally. Covering potential legal fees for following their advice would be far more expensive than providing a rental, yet they won\u2019t help. This entire ordeal has forced me to seek legal counsel just to address the negligence and lack of support I\u2019ve experienced. I\u2019ve reported them to the Oregon Consumer Protection Agency, BBB, and I\u2019m getting in contact with my attorney general as well.I urge anyone considering Driveway to think twice. This company\u2019s delays, dismissive attitude, and irresponsible advice have been nothing short of appalling. If you value your time, money, and peace of mind, avoid Driveway. They have demonstrated a shocking disregard for customer well-being and legal compliance, leaving me without safe, legal transportation as my registration expires.",

        "text": "I\u2019ve had a highly unsatisfactory experience with Driveway.com and Lithia Motors. Since beginning the purchase process on August 20th, I have encountered numerous, unresolved issues that have caused extreme inconvenience, emotional distress, and financial strain. Despite my best efforts to work with the company to resolve these problems, I have been met with delays, inadequate responses, and lack of accountability.Below is a timeline of events, detailing my concerns and attempts to rectify the situation:* August 20, 2024: Initial contact with Akiree to begin the purchase process.* August 27, 2024: My credit union issued payment for the vehicle.* August 29, 2024: I paid $500, which was supposed to be refundable, to secure the vehicle.* September 4, 2024: After several requests, I finally received pictures of the vehicle. The pictures, which should have been provided prior to the $500 payment, revealed cosmetic issues, including scratches, nicks, and a small indent from a baby seat.* September 12, 2024: I received the vehicle but immediately noticed that two roof rails were missing. I called Akiree, who assured me the issue would be addressed.* September 13, 2024: Upon inspection, the vehicle had little to no gas, the coolant light was on, and there was no wiper fluid\u2014raising questions about the so-called \u201cinspection\u201d process. Later that day, while driving, the car suddenly lost acceleration and started smoking, leaving me stranded on the expressway with my children. The car was towed to Land Rover of Chattanooga for diagnostics.* September 16, 2024: Land Rover diagnosed a major coolant leak, an incorrect battery, and other issues, all discovered just days after receiving the vehicle.* Despite these serious issues, Driveway declined to extend my rental car period until I requested to speak to a manager.* October 3, 2024: After receiving the vehicle back, I experienced further mechanical failure while driving to Atlanta. The car jerked, and I had to return to Land Rover, where they found a misfire requiring spark plug replacement. Once again, Driveway offered insufficient support, agreeing only to cover half of the costs despite the dangerous situation this car has repeatedly put me in.* October 10, 2024: I requested full coverage of the repairs due to the vehicle being in such poor condition at the time of purchase. Driveway refused, offering only a partial refund for repairs.* As of October 15, 2024, I am still without a functional vehicle, have yet to receive my $500 refundable payment, and have received zero updates or resolutions or my registration.October 15, after having an extensive call with the manager he called my husband back and said they would cover the spark plugs repair BUT NOT the rental car. I explained that we had no other transportation since we haven\u2019t had our vehicle. I asked for themTo please cover all of the rental expenses because we still have not received the check from them to get our car. The manager Parker was clear that they will NOT cover the repairs and the rental - he said I had to choose one.Update: October 17 @4:48pm it was communicated that form would be sent for us to sign to even process the check. We then received a message at almost 7:00pm saying the form was sent which means it would take additional days for us to receive the check.October 19 @ 9:27am enterprise called to tell me that I have an outstanding bill for $721. I am just in disbelief. Driveway paid for two days but yet I have NO vehicle or check.Throughout this ordeal, I have experienced not only a lack of customer service, but also a disturbing lack of compassion and responsibility from Driveway.com. Despite having paid for this vehicle and insurance, I have only been able to use it twice\u2014both times resulting in breakdowns that put me and my family in danger.I\u2019ve been patient, polite and fair but at this point I can\u2019t take it anymore. All I wanted was a functional vehicle and no $500 rental car tab.",

        "text": "The purchase process is flawless so the one star isn't for the sales team.  They are very professional, helpful and quick.  The customer service call center and chat operators are very good at their jobs and try to help.  The problem is with the delivery process.  I purchased a 2019 Lexus UX from Driveway on 9/21/24.  I loved the car, based on how it appeared on the website. From my car searches online, I hadn't seen another one like it.  You know how when shopping and you finally see the perfect item and get the feeling of \"That is it, That's the one!\"  I had that feeling and  therefore decided it was worth paying the more expensive delivery cost to bring it from California to North Carolina.  The interior is unique and very nice. However, I have yet to see it in person, let alone drive it, because it hasn't been delivered as of noon on Monday, 10/7/24.  When it was finally put on the truck on 9/29/24, Clara in shipping updated me about this status via text.  I got excited that my car was en route.  I checked in with Clara mid week and was told that it was on time for delivery to the distribution center on Friday, 10/4 and I would be updated once it was delivered. I am in eastern NC and the western part of the state was devastated by hurricane flooding.  I became concerned that the delivery drivers wouldn't be able to get through because large sections of I-40 are impassable.  Partially concerned for their safety and a potential delay, I checked in with Clara and informed her about the roads and asked her to please check on the drivers.  She replied \"Got It\" and kept insisting via text in what seemed like a robotic tone, that the vehicle is on time for delivery to the distribution center on 10/4.  It felt like my text questions were bothering her and I do not like to do that.  However, by 5:00 pm on 10/4 when I hadn't been updated the car was delivered to the distribution center, I texted Clara again and asked for an update and asked if they work late into the evenings.  I got her same robotic reply, delivery is confirmed on 10/4.  She then immediately texted me again and added the distribution center is neither open late nor open on the weekends.  It was a big let down because I was so looking forward to showing off my new wheels over the weekend. I asked her what happened to being on time for delivery to the distribution center on 10/4?  To that, she said she would have the supervisor contact me leaving me to wonder if there was an accident or some other issue that requires a supervisor to let me know about.  I have never heard from a supervisor.  I started the purchase process on 9/21.  Today is 10/7 and as far as I know, the vehicle could be on the moon.  I have no idea when it will get to the distribution center.  I have no way to get around as my other car was sold. I keep mentioning distribution center in my review because it is important to note that if you are expecting to get your car the day it arrives at the distribution center, you will not.  Clara fails to inform you that it has to go through a process when it gets there so only God knows when the actual delivery date to me is.  I sure have no idea when I am getting my car.  In the meantime, I have financed the car and the first payment will be due on 11/9/24.  I am going to be paying for a whole month for a car that I do not have. I am seriously considering canceling this purchase because I have been stuck at home with no car to drive since I started the purchase process on 9/21.  I cannot get to work and at some point, I am going to lose my job and then won't be able to pay for the car.  I have been lucky enough to work from home but do not want to keep pushing that.However, my down payment funds are now tied up in the Lexus and if I cancel, I would have to wait an additional unknown time period to get the money returned to buy another vehicle.  It is quite a conundrum and a mess.  Just know that if you need a car, do not consider an online purchase where the car is being delivered to you from out of state.  I know I naively made that decision; foolishly trusting that it would not take so long get from California to North Carolina.  I wouldn't be so upset if I was honestly communicated with about this issue/process.  But, I have been continuously told the car was on time for delivery to the distribution center on 10/4.  Even in the age of cellphones, no one actually checks to see if that is true. Obviously it was not delivered to the distribution center and I haven't yet been informed of that nor have I been told when I would actually have a car. I am losing money each day I am not able to use the car.  I am so disappointed. Driveway has to get a better handle on their shipping process.  Once they do, they will have a good system.  Until then, I believe these kinds of reviews will hurt them. ",

        "text": "Things started off so well. The individual I first spoke with was very helpful and responded to my information provided very quickly. Then I got transferred to my paperwork coordinator, this is where things started to fall apart. If I had a question, I couldn't get a response. I kept receiving emails that stated things needed done in a timely manner, but I couldn't reach anyone. I finally reached out to a supervisor that was able to help me with the remainder of the paperwork. They claimed they didn't have my wire transfer sent 3 days prior, which was very concerning! After it was located, I was sent to ANOTHER person who was a delivery coordinator. He was very responsive...at first.  He originally told me I would receive my new vehicle on Monday, September 9th. Monday came and went with no communication and no vehicle. Late Tuesday I receive a call stating that the delivery driver will be arriving late and will deliver my car the next morning. I ask if it will be delivered prior to 2 pm, as I had to go to work. I get a text response of \"I can't tell you that\". At this point I'm frustrated, worried I spent money on a vehicle I'll never receive, or a who knows. Finally, I get a message stating it will be delivered \"sometime after lunch\". Great! I will be here. Noon comes and goes and still no word. Now I'm freaking out. I reach out to 3 different people and no one is able to give me an estimated time. After a bit I get an estimate of 3-4 pm. Mind you, it's WEDNESDAY now. The vehicle was supposed to be here Monday!! I have to inform them that no one will be here due to my work schedule and my husbands schedule. I have to try to adjust the time to 5 pm so we can coordinate. I get a response of \"that should be fine\". At 4:26 pm I receive a phone call from an individual who spoke very broken English stating he couldn't come to my house to drop off the vehicle and he needed someone to meet him on the main road out from our house, which is a VERY busy main road. I tried to explain to him that our road loops around. He can make it. But he refused to listen. My husband jogged down to the main road and waited. Once the truck arrived he stopped part way in someone's yard amd part in the main road!! My husband had to try to direct traffic around the truck while the deliverer proceeded to offload my new vehicle into someone's yard, onto a busy road and back it into this other individuals driveway. Meantime the homeowner comes home and needs in their driveway now blocked by this truck and my new vehicle. Luckily, the homeowner was very sweet and understanding. After signing the papers my husband proceeds to drive the new vehicle back to the house where he realized he only had one key faub. SO, the next day I contact the company about obtaining another faub. I was basically told no. I got a response of \"typically used vehicles only come with 1 faub\". Not my trade in! It comes with two! No informed me it was missing a faub when I purchased it and it wasn't stated in the description that it only had one faub. Nice! Onto the 7 day trial period. I made a point to have the vehicle FULLY inspected, especially after the whole ordeal I had been through. Thankfully, things were in order and is a sound vehicle. I expected a phone call of some sort asking of I liked the vehicle or if I planned to keep it before they picked up my trade-in. Nothing! I got a phone call the following Wednesday to let me know they were coming to pick up my trade-in. We'll, ok then. Good thing I planned to keep the new vehicle. The pick up was very uneventful, thankfully, and they were able to come down my street...imagine that! At this point I am STILL waiting on plates and a title. My temp tags expire in 6 days. Needless to say, I'm not optimistic that they will come in time. I began this whole process August 20th, didn't receive the vehicle until late September 11th, and as of September 30th I still don't have my title, registration, or plates. I do NOT recommend Driveway. Communication is terrible and there timeline to do things is very asscued.",

From initiating the purchase, waiting for a delivery date, and when I would obtain final registration.  Sometimes I would have to make a stink before the ball got rolling.On the other hand, I obtained a vehicle that matched my needs perfectly and at a rather solid price.  I might have just been lucky, though I can\u2019t really complain here.The customer experience leaves a bit to be desired.

Why it\u2019s not 5 is because of a few things: Delivery time and detailing issues.I received my car, understanding it was used, it smelled like someone had smoked in it before. Granted, they provided a history of the car and what it was used for prior to. Knowing it was a fleet vehicle that had an accident, I kinda knew what to expect but nothing else was mentioned other than the repair and the accident. Steering wheel has a worn joint or bearing, making a slight scraping sound when turning the wheel. Used a refresher for the interior to hopefully get rid of the smell and it did, but I know the upholstery will need to get cleaned as well.In addition, the wheel alignment was not done properly or properly inspected. After driving a couple of miles, the steering wheel would slightly jitter as I\u2019m driving, especially on a straight road.Delivery time. Timeframe was given for an hour. Waited at my residence before the time of delivery just to get it almost 30 mins after the timeframe. Although 30 mins is pretty short, it defeats the purpose of the time slot window to deliver the car.Otherwise, pretty simple and easy process. Would recommend if you\u2019re considering other car buying options aside from Carvana, True Car, and others. If anything just be cautious with the used car inventory and thoroughly check the info as the buyer.",

Afterwards, I e-signed the documents and received DMV paperwork via FedEx for wet signatures, which I returned.Priscilla, my new representative, was also helpful and friendly. However, the next representative, Cheyenne, who is a dispatcher, provided incorrect information and was rude. She did not follow up with me and did not respond to my texts or calls, indicating a lack of follow-up and communication as the process continued.My credit union sent the check to the dealership, which was received on Monday, Sept 16th, and the car was delivered to my driveway on Wednesday, the 18th. The car was driven from the Valet Delivery Center to my home, and the Valet representatives were helpful. They pointed out a chip in my windshield and advised me to contact Driveway for repair, for which they were happy to reimburse me. However, I had to persistently follow up as there was a lack of communication, leading to delays in receiving the reimbursement.As for the $500 holding deposit, there has been a mix-up, and I am still waiting for them to contact me once the transaction is complete.

We had to use the emergency key to open the car. The dash stated that the battery needed to be replaced. After replacing the car went into reprogram mode. During this time every time we opened the doors the alarm would go off and the fob did not work at all. We requested the car be returned. The Rep stated it sounds like the fob just needed reprogramming. We attempted to call a locksmith with no avail and no help from the sales Rep. The power locks only lock from inside and do not unlock. We have stated that the car is not functioning and would like to return it several times. It has been in my driveway now 3 weeks and can\u2019t even start it up. The staff with vehicle were very deceitful and never followed up on anything they said. We have had to call over and over. Just recently did we get the forms to return it. I would like to add that once getting ahold of a supervisor named Amy our return has started. She has been super helpful and compassionate. It WAS the dealership in Elk Grove that pushed out a lemon. ALSO the robo generated response is BULLS&@T!!!!! This vehicle has never been in a repair shop !!!!! So what are they monitoring. ",

        "text": "Absolute disaster. Do not use Driveway.comUpdate after car secured:I decided now that I have the car and the plates, I'll provide more substance to my 1 star review. My reason for using Driveway.com was that I test drove in person a dozen cars at Honda dealerships near my home. I knew exactly the car that I wanted, but I just couldn\u2019t find it near me. I found it on Driveway and so I took a gamble. Looking back on it now, I should have settled for the purple version of the exact car I wanted at a local dealership. Or just kept looking locally.Simply put, if Driveway was the only place to buy a car, I would walk. Or buy a horse.Initially Securing the Car:I purchased the car with a combination of cash and a loan directly from my credit union. To secure the car, you need to show proof you can pay for it. The $500 deposit does not secure the car for you. My car was on a Honda dealership lot in New Jersey. Driveway reps were pushing me to get them proof I could pay ASAP. I had cash and pre-approval in writing from credit union. That was not enough, they said. The dealership will only hold the car if they have a pic of the actual check from the credit union. The problem is the credit union requires the VIN# and their check is based on that exact car. See the problem? There\u2019s a gap in securing the loan and that car even being available. Someone could have walked on the lot in Jersey and purchased the car I just took a out a loan specifically for. At the time, it was really stressful, and the Driveway reps didn\u2019t see this as a problem and seemed to wish I was financing through them directly (at a much higher interest rate). The car was available after I got the check from the credit union and the car was available, but I think I know why.State of the Car:Nobody was going to buy this car in person at the dealership. The reason? It stinks. It smells like someone chainsmoked four packs a day in the car. This was not disclosed prior to purchase, so please if you buy a car from Driveway ask specifically if the previous owner was a smoker. At one point in this process, because Driveway reps were not providing me information and I believe were stalling in order for my 7 day grace period to return the car was over, I reached out directly to the dealership. I asked the salesman, \u201cAre all the cars on these online companies stinky cars?\u201dHe goes, \u201cNo, no \u2026 we also have new cars.\u201dThat\u2019s all I\u2019m going to write about that.Communication Breakdown:Despite the stink, the most frustrating part of the experience was the communication. Throughout this process I communicated (either via text, email, or call because it seemed to depend on their preference not mine) to no less than 13 Driveway employees.Some of these individuals were nice and good at their jobs. Others I could tell had no idea what they were doing. I don\u2019t blame them, I blame Driveway for setting them up to fail. Each department is siloed from one another. Nobody knows what\u2019s going on at any point. And I never knew who to reach out to. Every other day a new Driveway rep was texting me or calling me to introduce themselves. I\u2019d follow up with that person, and I\u2019d be told oh no that\u2019s not the right person.Some of it was entertaining. At one point they told me they were shipping the car from Jersey to Massachusetts to a local dealership and a third party driver would bring it to me. That plan changed because they must have figured out Connecticut is between Jersey and Massachusetts. On a Monday, I got a call directly from a delivery company telling me they\u2019d be there that night. But then no car that night. Nobody reached out to me to tell me it wasn\u2019t coming, I called the # the delivery guy called from and he goes,\u201cWe\u2019re not coming tonight. They didn\u2019t tell you?\u201dThere was also a funny/scary moment when a Driveway.com rep called me and asked without any prelude, \u201cAre you wiring the money?\u201d\u201cWhat? I sent you two checks. A certified check and a check from the credit union.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re here.\u201dAt this point I\u2019m having a heart attack. Few moments later.\u201cOh. Here they are. We\u2019re good.\u201dThere was a lot of this type of thing. My 2022 Civic came with the manual for a 2011 CR-V. Driveway sent me a 2022 Civic manual, despite their rep telling me I could just get the manual online via my phone. I insisted and they sent me a manual.When the manual was on its way to me, a rep told me they were sending me a link to my original TrustPilot review. \u201cIf you could update that to 5 stars.\u201d\u201cYou want me to change my review from 1 to 5 stars?\u201dThey said that would be great. \u201cThese reviews are how my performance is determined.\u201dMind you, this was before my plates or registration were in my possession. They did come, on the day my 30-day temporary plates expired.If they hadn\u2019t asked, I might have changed the original reactionary review from 1 to a 2 or maybe even a 3. But no, I am leaving it at 1 star.",

I'm ASTOUNDED that ANYONE would agree to such terms. At that point, if Driveway.com finds or INVENTS fault or changes their mind, they can pay whatever they'd like, and seller would have to resort to litigation to get redress? They aren't kidding when they say possession is 9/10s of the law. I told them to kick rocks, think you should too.UPDATE:After the initial review (above) I was contacted by their head of operations. He confirmed the policies, but assured me that he could verify that my bank participated in their Immediate Payment system, which in fact they did. Still wasn't thrilled about having to sign and ship documents prior to getting funds, but agreed to try.  But turns out it went like clock work. Dealer rep showed up on schedule to pick up the car, and when I asked about funds transfer, he said he had no idea since he wasn't with Driveway So I told him no go until I contact Driveway, which I did. The rep there spoke to the dealer's driver to confirm pickup, and IMMEDIATELY initiated payment. The funds hit my account before the vehicle left my driveway (no pun intended). Driveway went the extra mile to make the deal, and earned my trust. Can't speak to buying, but selling to them turned out to be easy and reliable, and they made BY FAR the most reasonable offer.

After some back and fourth Driveway is going to pay out a very large portion and I'm content with the outcome. My wife gets her dream car and I have had an overall good experience with driveway and would use them again.",

They did tell me I would not receive a temporary tag due to NC rules, but that if I received a ticket they would take care of it, but then sent me paperwork that said they were not responsible. Typical car sales talk that I was trying to avoid. But overall, it has been smooth. Transport is a 1 star. Transport never called me for arrangements. I received a text 330pm the day before saying Driver will be there at 8am tomorrow. Umm, I work. So on delivery they did this. I complained, so on pick up of my vehicle a week later, they did the EXACT same thing. Both times I had to scramble to take care of it which was not convenient as I was out of town for work. I told driveway ahead of time and they assured me Transport would call in advanced. Also the car was delivered dirty inside and less than half tank gas. I called dealership directly and complained. Supposedly sending me a check for $150. I have not seen it yet. Patrick a customer service rep did reach out and sent me tracking for the check which I did receive and he was able to get a temp tag for me. So not a terrible experience, just know it will take longer than you'd expect. ",

Saying it was no problem, as long as I paid for the diagnostic up front, they would reimburse me and pay for the repair. When they were unable to find the source of the leak with the initial diagnostic and recommended taking apart the transmition to find it (labor cost of $1100) suddenly the car was and older car (2020) and they weren't certain if the labor would be covered, even if they did find a faulty part and had it repaired. I feel like they would have used any tiny excuse to wiggle out of the return. I'm glad it was within the 7 days and I didnt drive it, so it was below 400 miles. They also advertised the vehicle without a remote start. It was the main reason I picked this car. Their remedy was $500 towards the install of a remote start. Turns out if remote start doesn't come with the car, it's not something that can be installed later. It was within the 7-day time frame, so I opted to return the vehicle. I can't get my money back until they decide to pick up the car, which they also don't want me to drive in the meantime. So now I'm out the delivery fee of $1600 or so. It took over 2 weeks to get the vehicle. A week dealing with the diagnoses, and now they are saying 12-15 days for them to pick it up. I will avidly be recommending anyone steer clear of any online car buying experience. ",

The dealership paperwork did not match the proposal we signed with Driveway.com and we didn't realize it until later in the day. Ryan went above and beyond his job responsibilities to work with contracts and the dealership to get this right. We did get a refund of the difference from the dealership. Patrik from Driveway reached out to us during this time based on our initial review and between him and Ryan they provided stellar customer service.

My car didn\u2019t get cleaned as promised, no one responded to my emails within the 7 day/400 mile period, so good thing I didn\u2019t want to return my vehicle. They forgot paperwork and I kept having to overnight things back and forth. Rude phone call with one woman. Others ignored my calls, emails and texts. Gave up trying to have the busted key fob replaced. Once phone call went on 10 minutes before the guy realized he was looking at the wrong profile and wasn\u2019t talking about my car at all. It felt like no one wanted to do their individual jobs, dumping me on the next person again and again. Maybe they\u2019re overwhelmed with business or short staffed\u2026 I\u2019m still waiting on my plates/registration info when my temporary plates expired 2 days ago. (they just finally sent them today, not sure when I\u2019ll receive them) Driveway will sell you a car! You will get the car!

Since I am an out of state buyer, they directed me to Driveway.com. where the car was in fact listed for sale. Why? if the dealership hadn't checked out the vehicle, & told me that the car had no price yet. Driveway.com apparently lets dealerships list cars whose condition is completely unknown.  You could buy a car that has serious mechanical errors and believe it had been checked out by mechanics. The other reviews here reflect that many customers have exactly this experience, they purchase rusty cars, with dents and dings, that fail within 4-6 months.  Driveway would have added $2400 in shipping costs, taxes, and fees to the price of the car. If I had handled shipping costs, taxes and fees myself, I'd have paid $1000, not $2400 in addition to the price of the car.  What's more, Driveway.com's shipping costs are twice as high as those of other reputable shipping companies. This is basically yet another way in which consumers are being ripped off. ",

        "text": "This was the worst experience of my life one thing to another to another, just kept going wrong. I started by purchasing a car and after two weeks, it couldn\u2019t be shipped to me because The New Jersey dealership did not have possession of the title, and when they did have possession of it, they had to get it retitled to their dealership which would take over two months by the way.  After this happened, I did end up purchasing another car through  Driveway which was another nightmare they didn\u2019t comp or change the shipping for me. I actually ended up paying over $3000 more to get the new car dealership and shipping fees since it was a little bit further in. Florida- the original car from nj that i cancelled & never actually received - i got a bill in the mail saying that I am almost $800 past due om 18000 loan- even though i verified over and over again that I would not get charged anything for this car . ..on my current car, it was delivered to me with scratches & a dent  on it that i was  not told about.it was not cleaned or detailed at all. - there was dirt and debris inside and out, and a candy stuck on the carpet in the backseat It was delivered almost a week later than the original date and when I tried to talk to the satisfaction team, they offered me $150 and wanted me to sign a form stating that I would release Driveway from any legal liability forever in the future . - contacting Lithia Corporate was a joke. They never even responded back to me even after five phone calls. and on top of that my current car payment I can\u2019t even figure out how to pay since I haven\u2019t even received a bill for this even though they told me that my payment was going to be due 98 which now is in four days -so I know have to try to make all sorts of phone calls today to figure out how I\u2019m supposed to pay this car payment since they didnt send me any information. This was the worst experience of car buying I have ever had and I will never do it again, in addition to all the fines and fees that they have they also charge me $1049 more than what I was told on the price of the car - not the shipping intrest dealership state fees ect the cost of the actual car was different in my delivery packet than what I had initially signed for, but that\u2019s an issue for another day all in all this was horrific. I don\u2019t know how this is even open or why they even exist. I thought they would be better than Carvana since I heard Carvana has title issues, but at this point, I wish I just stuck with them. It was one issue after another after another after another never seemed to be able to fix anything or make it any better. yes, I did finally end up with a car, but it took a month and a half during which time I had to pay for insurance since day one because that\u2019s their policy to get a car. Is that right after you pick the car you need to get insurance immediately after you place your deposit before they will go sny further. Personally, I wish I\u2019d read a review like this because it would have made me stay away, and I hope whoever reads this keeps my warning and stays away",

I would even do a commercial testimonial ad for them if they wanted me to!!!This is no bull. I tried Carvana, True car and the others . Driveway I just trusted from the first call!!  From the start of the whole process. Ooooh and the best thing is you actually talk to people!!!! Leave a message someone calls back!!! Anyone who reads this doesn't really know how picky person I am. But the people who DO know me would not believe i wrote this. I could write so much more that was great about them. Thank you all again. Sarah, you are top notch!!! I wish you and Driveway all the best!!",

Being that the vehicle is a used as is vehicle I decided to try it out, knowing I had the flexibility of returning the vehicle if  it wasn\u2019t as expected. I picked up the vehicle once it was verified that it was still available, and made my deposit. Once at the dealership everything was a breeze. Did a pre purchase inspection and everything checked out.Pros- The team agents of driveway are quick to response back to your inquiry.-provide detail information of the vehicle.-Dealer allocated cars.Con-There might be a time zone difference depending what agent you reach out to.",

The car was quite dirty and smelled, with bunch of dog hair still stuck on the roof and in the back. I had to spend time detailing it myself. Also, the backup camera is fuzzy/not clear, and clearly shouldn\u2019t be like that. Overall, I don\u2019t think this is an honest company and I would stay away.",

My one negative experience was with W.R. from contracting. He wasn't very professional in his communication in my opinion. He stated that we was going to sign and send a form that same day that  the bank needed but he never did it. I had to call in and someone else , who was extremely helpful, had to fill out the form to preventing delaying the process. Another issue was that he failed to get my plates transferred like I asked. I called about it and someone else was able to explain the situation and we came up with a  solution where I would be reimbursed once I did the transfer at the DMV myself. Overall I had a great experience and would buy and recommend them. I would just say to switch to someone else is W.R. is your contracting guy.  ",

I immediately filed a report and was told to take vehicle to dealer to get estimate which came in at ($1300).   two weeks later Driveway offers me $200 and I say, no thanks I'll return vehicle - they say I missed deadline after dragging their feet for two weeks.  they refuse to fix damage, refuse to pay estimate from their own partner, and refuse to accept return - Shady business practice at best.",

They did nothing to make up for the unnecessary hit to our credit. Rather than going somewhere else and going through a credit approval again we decided just to pick a different car. It took almost 3 weeks for delivery, during which time driveway informed us that it was having work done on it. They never told us what was wrong. Once we received the car it quickly through a check engine light. We contacted driveway and they said they would reimburse us for the diagnostic and to get them an itemized quote with labor and part numbers. Turns out the check engine light is an easy fix, not really a problem. But thank goodness we took it in to a dealership, they did their normal multipoint inspection and found that head gasket, and oil pan seals are leaking, rear shocks bed to be replaced and one of the axels is leaking. Over $7000 worth of work. Needless to say, unless driveway cover this, we will be returning the vehicle. I don\u2019t think the mechanical troubles are necessarily driveways fault, since the car is from a separate dealership, but maybe it\u2019s a sign they don\u2019t hold the dealerships they work with accountable.",

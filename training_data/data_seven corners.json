I purchased Cancel for Any Reason Insurance on 2/28/23 for a trip to the Middle East, which we canceled prior to any penalties, later in 2023. I was advised by a Seven Corners agent that I could simply shift the policy for our replacement trip to Japan in 2024, and I specifically asked in writing whether our Cancel for Any Reason benefits remained intact. I was told in writing that they would, so I trusted the Seven Corners agent that I was fully covered. Had I not been told this, I would have purchased new insurance. I indeed had to file a Cancel for Any Reason Claim but felt comfortable, based on the Seven Corners agent's assurances by email regarding my policy, that my claim would be straightforward. Additionally, I have my policy statement for the new trip showing the initial deposit date as 2/10/23. I just received notification three months after filing the claim that Seven Corners has rejected my claim, stating that my initial deposit date (which they revised and are now saying was in May 2023 even though it is listed on my official policy as 2/10/23) was after my insurance purchase, not within the 20 day window as required, in spite of the documentation that the initial deposit was within 20 days, a email request from the claims reviewer to provide proof of that documentation (stating in that request that 2/10/23 was the \"initial deposit date,\" which later the company, in its denial, says it was not), and the email from their agent stating that my Cancel for Any Reason benefits remained intact for the new trip to Japan. I am most disappointed and have filed an appeal including this documentation. In the meantime, do yourself a favor and please do not trust this company. I purchased an expensive policy in good faith and followed the advice of their agent and claims reviewer, only to find that they denied my claim based on information that is not what is clearly listed on my policy (initial deposit date) and was advised in writing by their own agents. If their agents made a mistake and misadvised me in writing, I should not be responsible for that, nor should I have an expensive claim denied on that basis.

We had onboard medical expenses of $350 and $411 between us. We filed a claim with 7 Corners. The claims submission process is not easy. They ask for  things like credit card statement showing you paid for cruise. Then we waited 6 weeks, and heard nothing. I called and they said they needed proof we paid for the medical services (we had already provided the detailed medical bill and they did not specify wanting proof of payment of the medical charges at the onset). Obviously any company that deals with cruises as 7 Corners does, knows that no cruise line is going to let a passenger off the ship without paying their entire bill (for booze, t-shirts, medical services, etc). After many hoops, we got a final stateroom bill from Princess cruises and submitted it to 7C. But I believe the stall tactic and the ridiculous \"proof of payment\" was merely an effort to not pay a legitimate claim. The bean counters at 7C know that the more hoops they make people jump through, the fewer claims they have to pay. 7 Corners is not an honest company when it comes to paying claims and their responsiveness (or lack thereof) in customer service is pathetic. You can't just send them an email from the website, you have to upload documents and then wait for a reply (which they don't reply to).UPDATE: Seven Corners has gone from bad to worse. After providing my stateroom charges, they informed me they would pay $151 of my over $300 claim. They came to this figure as it was the \"balance\" of my stateroom bill when I got off the ship. This includes all charges and credits (I had several hundred dollars of credits after a port-of-call was cancelled at which I had paid for an activity, I cancelled a specialty dinner, and had a $100 credit as part of booking promotion). So, Seven Corners paid me only the balance of what I owed Princess Cruises, not the actual out of pocket costs I incurred for a covered claim from having visited the cruise medical center.They pulled the same scam with my travel partner's claim. I am filling a complaint with my state insurance commissioner and speaking to a lawyer. This company is a total scammer. They don't know who they are effing with!Update 2: After a lot of kicking and screaming, and making my case, 7 Corners said they are going to issue full payment of my claim. Laura and David at 7C were helpful, but it should not have been this hard to get a legit claim paid.

We had to spend another night and had to leave the next morning.  The airline paid for the hotel so I did not add that to my claim.  Only food, taxi transportation and one clothing item because I was cold. The claim was fairly easy to input although I had to send the validating documents separately because it kept deleting them (file was too big which I found odd since it was just a few receipts).  I sent them directly to their customer service email. I chose 4 stars for good phone customer service and some direction on the site that I had difficulty using. What remains to be seen is the ease of getting the few hundred dollars I submitted paid to me.  It was actually roughly the cost of the policy itself.

However, under the circumstances, each entity gave me a 100% refund although we were outside the cancellation time for the airline and condo rental, which was the significant portion of what the loss would have been. It is outrageous that Seven Corners lacked empathy and disallowed me to cancel the policy under this situation. For full disclosure, they did offer to \"suspend\" the insurance to allow me to apply it WITHIN 1 YEAR, in case we reschedule out trip. I tried to explain that does me no good since our plans were in West Maui, specifically in Lahaina, which will NOT be rebuilt within a year. I trust they will reply to this review with something about the terms of the policy not allowing a cancellation, but I remind everyone reading this that Delta Airlines and VRBO could have invoked their non-cancellation terms also and forced me into a credit situation.

I have dutifully submitted all the required documentation, but they seem to have made no effort to respond or address my concerns. Their lack of communication and unresponsiveness have left me frustrated and anxious about the status of my claim.I have tried reaching out to them via email and phone calls numerous times, but my attempts have been met with silence. It is disheartening to see such a lack of concern for their customers, especially when they are obligated to provide the services they have promised.As a last resort, I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) in the hopes that it would prompt a response from Seven Corner Insurance Company. However, even the BBB complaint has not elicited any reply from the company. My research on the BBB website has further revealed that my experience is not an isolated incident, as there are other customers facing similar issues with the company. It is distressing to see Seven Corner listed as a company with multiple complaints and no resolution, despite their claims of being the best insurance company, as highlighted on their website with a Forbes award in 2023.I firmly believe that consumers should be protected from such fraudulent practices, and it is imperative that authorities step in to safeguard our rights as consumers. Misleading promises and lack of accountability from insurance companies can have severe consequences for individuals who rely on their services to protect themselves and their families.I kindly request your intervention in this matter and urge you to investigate the actions of Seven Corner Insurance Company thoroughly. They should be held accountable for their misleading practices, lack of responsiveness, and failure to fulfill their obligations to their customers, as outlined in their policy agreements.MOST ANNOYING THAT YOU WILL FIND THE COMPANY WILL RESPOND TO ANY REVIEW LIKE (I will put in an escalation request to look into your claims.

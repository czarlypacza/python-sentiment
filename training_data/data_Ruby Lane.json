Blocking numerous honest collectors who have good customer relationships with the sellers just because of the actions of a few bad apples. These bad apples exist in ALL countries -- would hate to think there was any racist bias here. Seems to me it would make more sense to strengthen the website's security and infrastructure?!

The contrast was pushed to give the rug an almost black frame in the pictures. The actual rug has a mid-tone brown frame. The background of the motif looks cream/white in the ad pictures used, but the actual rug has a tan background. Bonnie Boswell should not alter the colors and contrast of what she is selling. Good points of the transaction: the rug is in good condition and it arrived promptly. ",

So, I wanted to offer more.  I sent a message to DLA asking if they'd accept my next higher bid.  Regina, at DLA, was very helpful and agreed to the price proposed.  Upon her direction, I went back to your website and attempted to key in the new agreed-upon price and then order the items.  But it wouldn't allow me to enter the agreed-upon price.  I got back with Regina who contacted you all. She was told that the system would not allow me to enter a new bid.  Thus, she was able to discount the item (to the price she and I agreed upon.  I then went back into the site to purchase it.  But I kept being cued to do so by using PayPal, which I didn't want to do.  I continued clicking on \"change\" (for the method of payment I wished to use).  But that didn't work.  Finally, I found directions that directed me to go ahead and press \"PayPal\" and then on a subsequent page, click on debit card/credit card.  I did that and it worked.It was kind of frustrating to navigate your purchase process due to the lack of clarity and efficiency in the way you have things set up.  However, again Regina at Douglas Lane Antiques was very helpful and thus, did a great job.  I look forward to receiving the glasses!",

Maybe it was a bad decision by an out of touch CEO, but on the face it looked like betrayal. Something has changed at the top on RL and it trickled like acid rain down on everyone.  It was an all too familiar story and sadly - trust is gone. At least if costs had legitimately gone up, the starting number could have been 2%??  I used to grab people by the shirt sleeves and rattle their arms telling them about Ruby Lane! It was relaxing, I made friends, it was very profitable and I wanted people to open shops there to encourage the trajectory.. What happened? I do still recommend RL, but with many provisos and warnings - which is too bad. If you could wish for one thing that Ruby Lane could change to make your selling experience better, what would it be?Get rid of image gallery. It takes me 3 minutes to list  on Ebay. It takes me an hour to list on RL. Whoever thought that having to load your pictures twice was a time saver? And who decided to make it so every photo you attach to the listing DISAPPEARS from the image gallery and if you need that photo you have to load it AGAIN? Sellers should have the discretion to delete the pictures per their convenience, not have to worry that if they make a mistake it will be another 10 minutes of their day wasted and to make matters worse, RL doesn't even save the draft if I close the window by accident or RL signs me out. NONE of this would ever happen if you were simply taking photos from your PC or phone. Besides, it's in the best interest of the sellers to take excellent photos.  If a seller is not representing the quality that RL requires it could be dealt with separately.  The AIP as well is all negativity. It seems that the entire image processing part of RL was designed to complicate and frustrate. And the images that result are low quality, amateurish and quite obviously not processed in the US.",

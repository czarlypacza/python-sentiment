But if I choose 3 products from your website the value will be certainly much more than 60$ so why you want me to pay shipping fee during all this ambassador talk?This company wrote to me on Instagram, they asked if I want to be an Ambassador of their products. Ambassador my foot! They said all I need to do is to pick 3 products from their website and I'll receive them FOR FREE. My work is to make Instastory or post with photo of their products mentioning their company name every month. Before I choose the products I decided to check reviews on TrustPilot. After I learnt the company is a scam I confronted them asking if it's true they want Ambassadors to pay 30$ for the shipping, I was just curious what they'll say. Guess what, after I asked them, they stopped answering me.

While I would much rather wear the jewelry and post to instagram to promote the company, I don\u2019t feel comfortable doing so considering the quality of the products I received. The CLAIRE earrings were definitely the best of the 3, they are heavy and seem well made and sturdy. The SYNIM necklace I wasn\u2019t so impressed with. I honestly looked at this piece and thought \u201cI could have made this myself\u201d. The gold circle is just a large jump ring, which is open. The two sides don\u2019t even touch- this looks incredibly cheap. The circle of pearls is actually just a circle of plastic beads. Lastly, I\u2019m not sure what you mean by waterproof- because if I were to wear this in the shower I\u2019m sure the plated stainless steel would not be a gold colour for very long. Lastly was the Monroe ring. If I\u2019m honest I bought a ring so that if I loved the products, I would be able to wear one of each piece for a photo to post. But looking to choose online I was really turned off by all of the ring choices due to the fact that none of them were actually closed. I understand this is cheaper for the company as you don\u2019t have to stock multiple sizes, but it looks incredibly cheap and there is no need for that considering it cost $70 on the site. I\u2019d also like to add that one of the stones in my ring came cracked or scuffed or something which made it matte and not sparkle like the rest which really stands out. I tried to get it in the photos. I\u2019d also like to point out how cheap and scrappy the packaging was. Perhaps my expectations were just too high but for jewelry, I was expecting at least a box. The cheap plastic envelopes and baggies were not a welcome surprise. If I\u2019m honest, my initial reaction after opening the bubble mailer was \u201cI\u2019ve been scammed\u201d. Other than the plastic, the stapled piece of paper with the bow on it attached to the necklace really screams \u2018made in china\u2019. While I appreciate not having to pay the $220 you would have charged for the three pieces, I did have to pay $30 in shipping which is odd and outrageous because the mailer said it had only been sent from Ontario.

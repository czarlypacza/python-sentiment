Only on 10/03/2024 did I send the money to him using the saved receivers in the Western Union Account, and my brother-in-law didn't receive the money. We waited one more day to see if it was a transaction delay. On the 4th, the money was delivered, but my brother never received the money. So I returned and found that the account and phone numbers were changed in the saved receiver. I thought someone had hacked the account, so I called Western Union. They responded poorly by saying the transaction was complete. So I had to call them three times to start an investigation finally. Minus the wait time and transfers! They told me I would get an email from them after the inquiry. On 10/06/2024, I got an email saying that the transfer was complete. It is as if I need an investigation to find out the status of a transfer; shame on the people who made this system and shame on people like me who believe in it.I am on a call with them today, 10/11/2024.

Is there a monthly limit for sending to a country? Is there a maximum amount you can send to an individual? You guys don't know. Your website is contradictory, and your customer service \"CAN'T\" answer anything. 2.   Have the ability to escalate a question to a supervisor.
